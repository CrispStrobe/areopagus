| 1 | RESPONSIO DE INTELLECTU EVANGELII IOANNIS QUOMODO RATIO DIVINA SIT VITA Fateor, uti ais amice optime, maximae profunditatis «volantis aquilae» scripturam evangelicam non posse sufficienter explicari, licet quisque modo suo aliquid ab alio differenter attingere possit; atque ideo ingressum facilem in ipsam a me frustra exigis, nisi mea delecteris qualicumque coniectura, quam, ut nunc spiritus ministrat, grate recipito! | RESPONSE CONCERNING THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN, HOW THE DIVINE REASON IS LIFE: I confess, as you say, my dearest friend, that the writing of the "soaring eagle," being of the greatest profundity, cannot be sufficiently explained, although each person may grasp something differently in their own way; and therefore you demand in vain an easy entry into it from me, unless you are pleased with some conjecture of mine, which, as the spirit now provides, receive gratefully! |
| 2 | Scis omnem illius scripturae sanctae causam theologum Ioannem affirmare Christi notitiam, ut ostendatur dei filius, in quo credentes vitam habent sempiternam. | You know that the theologian John affirms that the entire purpose of that sacred scripture is the knowledge of Christ, so that the Son of God may be revealed, in whom believers have eternal life. |
| 2 | Ad hanc ipsam assertionem omnes, qui rationis discursu gaudent, perducere satagens, primum quid per dei filium velit, ostendit, scilicet ipsum esse absolutam rerum omnium rationem seu patris sapientiam. | Striving to lead all who delight in the discourse of reason to this very assertion, he first shows what he means by the Son of God, namely, that He is the absolute reason of all things or the wisdom of the Father. |
| 2 | Nihil enim omnium sine ratione esse potest, sicuti enim in homine alia est ratio oculi et alia auris et alia manus, ut nullum membrum absque legitima ratione exsistat, quae quidem singulorum membrorum rationes in simplici ipsa totius hominis ratione complicantur, quae est ratio una omnium rationum, ita est una simplicissima universi ratio, in se omnium membrorum universi rationes complicans, quae est ratio, sine qua nec universum nec quidquam universi esse potest. | For nothing can exist without reason, just as in a human being the reason of the eye is different from that of the ear and the hand, so that no member exists without a legitimate reason, and indeed the reasons of the individual members are enfolded in the simple reason of the whole human being, which is the one reason of all reasons; so there is one most simple reason of the universe, enfolding within itself the reasons of all the members of the universe, which is the reason without which neither the universe nor anything in the universe can exist. |
| 3 | Haec autem ratio absoluta omnium, quae vel verbum vel logos vel sapientia dicitur, extra principium non est. | This absolute reason of all things, which is called the Word or Logos or Wisdom, is not outside the beginning. |
| 3 | Esset enim principiata, si extra principium foret. | For it would be originated if it were outside the beginning. |
| 3 | Omne autem principiatum, cum a se esse nequeat, sine ratione non est. | But everything that is originated, since it cannot exist by itself, is not without reason. |
| 3 | Et non est suiipsius ratio, quia principiatum. | And it is not its own reason, because it is originated. |
| 3 | Implicat enim suiipsius rationem pariter et principiatum exsistere. | For it implies that its own reason and its being originated exist simultaneously. |
| 3 | Hinc absoluta ratio, cum se neget principiatam, se in principio esse fatetur. | Hence, the absolute reason, since it denies that it is originated, acknowledges that it is in the beginning. |
| 3 | Est igitur in absoluto rerum principio verbum, logos seu ratio rerum. | Therefore, in the absolute beginning of things, there is the Word, the Logos, or the reason of things. |
| 4 | Et hoc quidem non est aliud quam apud patrem universi, quem omnes deum dicimus, esse ipsam rerum absolutam rationem, non eo modo quod verbum, quod est apud deum patrem, coincidat cum patre, quia apud ipsum est incoincidenter. | And this is nothing other than the absolute reason of things being with the Father of the universe, whom we all call God, not in such a way that the Word, which is with God the Father, coincides with the Father, because it is with Him in a non-coincident manner. |
| 4 | Alias enim, si coincidenter, non foret apud patrem, sed ipse pater. | For otherwise, if it coincided, it would not be with the Father, but the Father Himself. |
| 4 | Sic itaque est ratio in principio, et non coincidit cum patre, apud quem est, licet sibi omne id conveniat, ut rationi absolutae, quod patri convenit ut patri. | Thus, the reason is in the beginning and does not coincide with the Father, with whom it is, although everything that belongs to the Father as Father also belongs to it as the absolute reason. |
| 4 | Si patri convenit principium ut patri, convenit rationi ut rationi. | If the beginning belongs to the Father as Father, it belongs to the reason as reason. |
| 4 | Si patri convenit deitas ut patri, convenit deitas rationi ut rationi. | If divinity belongs to the Father as Father, divinity belongs to the reason as reason. |
| 4 | Si convenit patri aeternitas ut patri, convenit similiter rationi ut rationi. | If eternity belongs to the Father as Father, eternity similarly belongs to the reason as reason. |
| 5 | Quapropter cum absoluta ratio sit, per quam «deus fecit et saecula», erit deus qui saecula fecit, ut pater saeculi erit ratio absoluta omnia patris habens, patris sapientia, ratio seu filius, ut ipse sit filius aeternus aeterni patris, per quem fecit universa. | Therefore, since there is an absolute reason through which "God made the ages," God who made the ages will be, as the Father of the age, the absolute reason having all things of the Father, the wisdom of the Father, the reason or the Son, so that He Himself may be the eternal Son of the eternal Father, through whom He made all things. |
| 5 | Sic itaque absoluta rerum ratio est patris filius, quia nihil nisi a patre et omnia quae et pater habet. | Thus, the absolute reason of things is the Son of the Father, because nothing exists except from the Father and all things that the Father has. |
| 5 | Oportet enim absolutam rationem adaequari potentiae creativae, cum nihil sine ratione in esse prodire possit. | For the absolute reason must be equated to creative power, since nothing can come into being without reason. |
| 5 | Sic omnipotentia creativa perfectissime relucet in absoluta ratione. | Thus, creative omnipotence shines forth most perfectly in the absolute reason. |
| 5 | Nam cum sine ratione nihil esse possit et absoluta ratio sit omnium creabilium adaequatissima, perfectissima atque sufficientissima ratio, manifestum est omnipotentiam creativam in perfectissima sui relucentia absolutam generare rationem omnium creabilium complicativam. | For since nothing can exist without reason and the absolute reason is the most adequate, most perfect, and most sufficient reason of all creatable things, it is clear that creative omnipotence generates the absolute reason of all creatable things in the most perfect reflection of itself. |
| 5 | Logos igitur absolute prolatum est deus, filius dei patris, non alius in deitatis natura, quia «deus erat verbum», nec eadem quae dei patris persona, quia logos, licet sit «in principio», quod est in potentia creativa. | Therefore, the Logos, absolutely produced, is God, the Son of God the Father, not another in the nature of divinity, because "the Word was God," nor the same person as God the Father, because the Logos, though it is "in the beginning," which is in creative power. |
| 5 | Non tamen ipse deus pater, sed apud ipsum, ut ait theologus. | Yet He is not God the Father Himself, but with Him, as the theologian says. |
| 5 | Haec autem omnium creabilium absoluta ratio est omnia, ut viva omnium ratio. | Moreover, this absolute reason of all creatable things is all things, as the living reason of all. |
| 5 | Omnia igitur, ut sunt in ipsa ratione, sunt ipsa vita absoluta. | Therefore, all things, as they are in the reason itself, are absolute life itself. |
| 5 | Nihil enim extra rationem vivere potest. | For nothing can live outside of reason. |
| 5 | Ratio igitur est vita. | Therefore, reason is life. |
| 6 | Christus praedicavit hunc mundum penitus esse derelinquendum ob alium et vitam hanc sensibilem propter aliam intellectualem. | Christ preached that this world must be utterly abandoned for another and this sensible life for an intellectual one. |
| 6 | In mundo intellectuali non reperitur nisi veritas, scilicet obiectum intellectus, sicut in caelo visibili non nisi color, qui est obiectum visus. | In the intellectual world, nothing is found except truth, namely the object of the intellect, just as in the visible heaven there is nothing except color, which is the object of sight. |
| 6 | Ostendit autem deus supremo testimonio hanc vitam esse parvi pendendam propter veritatem, quae est vita intellectus alterius mundi. | Moreover, God has shown by the highest testimony that this life must be held in little regard for the sake of truth, which is the life of the intellect of another world. |
| 6 | Quoniam ad hoc venit in mundum et mortuus est, ut testimonium in sanguine suo perhiberet. | For He came into the world and died for this purpose, that He might bear witness in His blood. |
| 6 | Qui enim moritur pro veritate, «maius testimonium» perhibere nequit. | For he who dies for truth cannot bear "greater testimony." |
| 6 | Sic mors Christi certificavit nos et Uberavit ab ignorantia et ab omni malo, si recipimus testimonium; si non, tunc non habemus excusationem, quia «maius testimonium» ferri non potuit. | Thus, the death of Christ has assured us and freed us from ignorance and from all evil, if we accept the testimony; if not, then we have no excuse, because "greater testimony" could not be given. |
| 7 | Item nota quod deo qui est veritas non potest non credi. | Likewise, note that God, who is truth, cannot be disbelieved. |
| 7 | Sed dubium est solum, an spiritus sit ex deo. | But the only doubt is whether the spirit is from God. |
| 7 | Unde conscito quod filius dei sit ille qui loquitur et promittit gloriam aeternam, tunc non est haesitatio de promissis. | Therefore, knowing that the Son of God is the one who speaks and promises eternal glory, there is no hesitation about the promises. |
| 7 | Et omnia recipiuntur quae mandat et non potest esse fides maior quam illa. | And all things that He commands are received, and there can be no greater faith than that. |
| 7 | Ideo per fidem illam omnia assequitur credens. | Therefore, through that faith, the believer attains all things. |
| 7 | Unde nemo recipit etc, ut dicit Ioannes Baptista; experitur autem qui accipit, quoniam deus verax est, quod autem quis accipiat verba Iesu ut filii dei, inducitur ex hiis, quae supra hominem operatus est. | Hence, no one receives, etc., as John the Baptist says; but the one who accepts experiences it, since God is truthful, and that one accepts the words of Jesus as the Son of God is inferred from the works He performed beyond human capability. |
| 7 | Et ex hiis quae mandavit, quae talia sunt quod stante veritate quae deus est, illa mandata necessario probantur esse ex veritate. | And from the things He commanded, which are such that, given the truth which is God, those commands are necessarily proven to be from the truth. |
| 7 | Sic intellige quando Christus dicit «qui credit in me, habet vitam aeternam». | Understand it thus when Christ says, "He who believes in me has eternal life." |
| 7 | Nam quicumque credit Iesum esse filium dei, ille non potest nisi mandata eius servare, scilicet dilectionem; praecipit dilectionem et pro illa promittit vitam aeternam. | For whoever believes that Jesus is the Son of God cannot but keep His commandments, namely love; He commands love and for it promises eternal life. |
| 7 | Si vis vitam ingredi, serva mandata! | If you wish to enter life, keep the commandments! |
| 7 | Qui non servat mandata, signum est quod adhuc non habet completam fidem quod mandans sit deus aut filius dei. | Whoever does not keep the commandments shows that they do not yet have complete faith that the one commanding is God or the Son of God. |
| 7 | Fides autem est necessaria, sine qua nihil et per quam omnia. | Faith, however, is necessary, without which there is nothing and through which all things are possible. |
| 8 | Christus dicit deum qui eius pater est esse veracem et bonum. | Christ says that God, who is His Father, is truthful and good. |
| 8 | Ideo est obiectum rationalis spiritus, qui non appetit nisi scire verum et habere bonum. | Therefore, He is the object of the rational spirit, which desires nothing but to know the truth and possess the good. |
| 8 | Deus igitur est vita animae rationalis. | God, therefore, is the life of the rational soul. |
| 8 | Videt igitur intra se anima id esse deum suum, quod insatiabiliter appetit. | The soul, therefore, sees within itself that which it insatiably desires as its God. |
| 8 | Et dum discurrit per omnia huius mundi, non reperit nisi similitudinem aliquam eius quod quaerit. | And while it wanders through all things of this world, it finds only some likeness of what it seeks. |
| 8 | Et nisi linquat mundum, non pertingit ad quaesitum. | And unless it leaves the world, it does not attain what it seeks. |
| 8 | Nam deus quem quaerit exemplar est et absolutus ab omni eo, cuius est exemplar. | For God, whom it seeks, is the exemplar and is free from all that of which He is the exemplar. |
