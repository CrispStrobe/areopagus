| p | NICOLAI DE CUSA EPISTULA AD IOANNEM DE SEGOBIA Reverendissimo in Christo patri ac domino domino Ioanni, archiepiscopo Caesariensi, domino meo singularissimo. | The letter of Nicholas of Cusa to John of Segovia: To the most reverend father and lord, Lord John, Archbishop of Caesarea, my most singular lord. |
| p | Reverendissime in Christo pater, domine et amice singularissime, post recommendationem. | Most reverend father, lord, and singular friend, after the recommendation. |
| p | Recepi litteras vestras mihi utique gratissimas, quas legi et relegi, et de multis maximam recepi complacentiam. | I received your letters, which were most pleasing to me, and I read and reread them, and from many things I received the greatest satisfaction. |
| p | In primis quia nexum veteris inter nos amicitiae non tantum vidi integrum, sed potius tristi glutino conpactum, quod iocundissime intellexi. | First, because I saw that the bond of our old friendship was not only intact but also strengthened by a most pleasant glue, which I understood with great joy. |
| p | Maxime autem huius ostensio mihi patuit, quando secretiora mihi primum revelastis; et ut paucis utar, haec stet sententia nos et esse et manere semper amicos, affectibus atque operibus id ipsum attestantibus. | But especially the demonstration of this was clear to me when you first revealed to me the more secret things; and to use a few words, this sentiment stands: we are and will always remain friends, as our affections and works attest to the same. |
| p | Ad rem de qua scribit reverendissima paternitas vestra quam breviter descendens, admiratus sum certe et maxime gavisus quod ingenium vestrum mihi dudum notum in hanc se transtulit Alchorani discussionem. | Concerning the matter about which your most reverend paternity writes, descending to it briefly, I was certainly amazed and greatly delighted that your talent, which was known to me for a long time, has turned to the discussion of Alcoran. |
| p | Nam nunc fidei orthodoxae defensio exigebat talem zelosum atque apprime doctum, peracutum et memorativum reperiri. | For now, the defense of the orthodox faith required such a zealous and most learned, sharp, and memorable person to be found. |
| p | Neque blandiendo hoc dico; arbitror nullum diligentiorem atque aptiorem superesse ad hanc enodationem, experientia attestante in certis per reverendissimam paternitatem vestram Basileae elucidatis taliter quod nihil superaddendum restet. | I do not say this by flattery; I think that no one is more diligent and apt for this explanation, as experience testifies in certain things elucidated by your most reverend paternity at Basel, so that nothing remains to be added. |
| p | Cum indicem eorum quae tangitis legerem, comprehendi perfectionem gloriosi laboris. | When I read the index of the things you touched upon, I grasped the perfection of the glorious work. |
| 1 | Et quia caritas vestra in facto vellet certior fieri, ut missiva petit, parum superaddendum habeo hiis quae legi ad reverendissimam paternitatem vestram pervenisse. | And because your charity wished to be informed of the fact, as the letter requests, I have little to add to what I read has reached your most reverend paternity. |
| 1 | Dum vocarer ad dietam Ratisponensem per Caesarem, non decuit me ire sine iussu Pontificis. | While I was called to the diet at Ratisbon by the Emperor, it was not fitting for me to go without the order of the Pontiff. |
| 1 | Et quia voluit ut irem et exercitum disponerem offerendo marinum ex Ytalia, feci ut voluit et cedulam obtuli quam ex curia habuit reverendissima paternitas vestra. | And because he wished me to go and prepare an army by offering a fleet from Italy, I did as he wished and presented a note that your most reverend paternity had from the curia. |
| 1 | Et quia vix dieta illa dissoluta Veneti cum Turco pacem iurarunt aperiendo sibi dominia sua contra omnes adversarios, etiam Christianos, dummodo sui non cogerentur fidem negare, statim intellexi sanctissimum dominum nostrum oblationem non posse adimplere. | And because the Venetians, after the diet was dissolved, swore peace with the Turk, opening their dominions to him against all adversaries, even Christians, as long as they were not forced to deny their faith, I immediately understood that our most holy lord could not fulfill the offering. |
| 1 | Licet Veneti dicant se illis pactis non obstantibus viso exercitu valido velle cum nostris concurrere, prout haec sanctissimo domino nostro et Caesari intimarunt, tamen non creditur ipsis, maxime quia sine consilio fidelium – maxime capitum – iurarent. | Although the Venetians say that, seeing a strong army, they wish to concur with ours, as they have intimated to our most holy lord and the Emperor, nevertheless, they are not believed, especially since they swore without the counsel of the faithful – and mainly the heads – of the Church. |
| 1 | Adveniente itaque tempore dietae Francfordensis fui iterum per Caesarem solicitatus. | When the time of the diet at Frankfurt arrived, I was again solicited by the Emperor. |
| 1 | Sed quia sanctissimus dominus noster me ad componendum negotia inter ordinem Pruthenorum et patriam illam deputavit, non mihi scripsit uti ante quod Francfordiam accederem. | But because our most holy lord had deputed me to settle the affairs between the order of the Prussians and that land, he did not write to me to go to Frankfurt before. |
| 1 | Ita excusatus mansi, sed tenuit me verecundia. | Thus, I remained excused, but shame held me back. |
| 1 | Nam per litteras apostolicas ostendi me mandatum habere offerendi marinum exercitum, de quo non potui respondere. | For through apostolic letters, I showed that I had a mandate to offer a fleet, about which I could not respond. |
| 1 | Unde in Francfordia de passagio pro nunc nihil determinate conclusum est, sed quod sanctissimus dominus noster ordinet ut tota Ecclesia concurrat. | Hence, in Frankfurt, nothing was determined concerning the passage for now, but our most holy lord will ordain that the whole Church concur. |
| 1 | Solum petitio regis Ungariae de subsidio triginta milium peditum et decem milium equitum admissa est, ita quod in festo Purificationis apud Caesarem agatur de capitaneo et necessariis. | Only the petition of the king of Hungary for a subsidy of thirty thousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry was admitted, so that on the feast of the Purification, it will be discussed with the Emperor about the captain and necessities. |
| 1 | Et missum est ad sanctissimum dominum nostrum, ut iterum promissa quoad marinum adimpleat exercitum et clero per Alamaniam semidecimam pro hoc subsidio imponat. | And it was sent to our most holy lord that he again fulfill his promise concerning the fleet and impose a tithe on the clergy throughout Germany for this subsidy. |
| 1 | Nescio quid eveniet. | I do not know what will happen. |
| 1 | Nam communitates Ytaliae certa capitula pacis ad annos plus quam viginti cum duce Mediolanensi acceptata medio sanctissimi domini nostri, qui ob hoc reverendissimum dominum Firmanum Neapolim misit, rogant per regem Aragonum pariformiter iurari. | For the communities of Italy, having accepted certain chapters of peace for more than twenty years with the duke of Milan, through the mediation of our most holy lord, who for this reason sent the reverend lord Firman to Naples, ask through the king of Aragon to swear equally. |
| 1 | Quod si hoc habebitur, speratur de navigiis; alias non. | If this is done, there is hope for the ships; otherwise, not. |
| 1 | Et stante ambiguo in hoc puncto principali, de succursu Alamanorum haesito. | And since there is ambiguity on this principal point, I hesitate concerning the aid of the Germans. |
| 1 | Videtur enim ipsis hanc rem communem Ytalicos maxime tangere. | For it seems to them that this matter is common to the Italians, especially. |
| 1 | Habui tam ex Ungaria quam Ytalia Turcum hoc anno non profecisse. | I have learned from both Hungary and Italy that the Turk did not make progress this year. |
| 1 | Sed dum esset in civitate Sophia, quae Christianis approximat, ut aliquot milia hominum depraedaretur quos mitteret ad inhabitandum Constantinopolim, dispotus Rassiae cum adiutorio Ungarorum ipsum repulit multis milibus ex suis caesis. | But while he was in the city of Sophia, which is near the Christians, in order to plunder and send some thousands of men to inhabit Constantinople, the despot of Rascia, with the help of the Hungarians, repelled him, killing many thousands of his men. |
| 1 | Ex Albania similiter habuit conflictum. | He also had a conflict in Albania. |
| 1 | Et in mari perdidit navigia multa, ut vidi in littera cuiusdam capitanei Venetorum, qui praeest mari. | And at sea, he lost many ships, as I saw in a letter from a certain captain of the Venetians, who is in charge of the sea. |
| 1 | Haec praestant audaciam Ungaris, qui cum Bohemis et aliis subditis regi subsidio concurrente oblato sperant resistere Turco. | These things give courage to the Hungarians, who, with the help of the Bohemians and other subjects of the king, hope to resist the Turk. |
| 1 | Unde de passagio spes nulla, sed de resistendo illa quae praenarratur. | Hence, there is no hope for the passage, but for resisting, as has been told before. |
| 1 | Haec sunt quae in facto scribere possum. | These are the things that I can write concerning the fact. |
| 2 | De aliis vero duobus punctis reverendissima paternitas vestra doctior et prudentior non eget instructore. | As for the other two points, your most reverend paternity, being more learned and prudent, does not need an instructor. |
| 2 | Sed ne videar iuxta posse nolle complacere, quam breviter tangam quae occurrunt. | But lest I seem unwilling to please where I am able, let me briefly touch upon the matters that arise. |
| 2 | Visum est mihi omnino ita agendum cum infidelibus, uti placere conspicio reverendissimae paternitati vestrae, et de hoc scripsi libellum parvulum quem nominavi De pace fidei. | It seemed to me that we should deal with the infidels in such a way as I observe pleases your most reverend paternity, and on this I wrote a small book which I titled *De Pace Fidei*. |
| 2 | Utinam ad manum haberem quia mitterem, licet nihil in eo tale contineatur quod reverendissimae paternitati vestrae sit novum. | If only I had it at hand so that I might send it, though it contains nothing that would be new to your most reverend paternity. |
| 2 | Hoc saltim vidissetis quod una fuit utriusque cogitatio. | At least you would see that the thought of both of us was one. |
| 2 | Assentio igitur rationibus vestris fundatissimis tam in iure divino quam humano; quia si iuxta doctrinam Christi processerimus, non errabimus, sed spiritus eius loquetur in nobis, cui non poterunt omnes adversarii Christi resistere; sed si invasionis gladio aggressionem elegerimus, formidare habemus ne gladio pugnantes gladio pereamus. | I therefore agree with your most solid reasons, both in divine and human law; for if we proceed according to the teaching of Christ, we shall not err, but His Spirit will speak in us, to whom all adversaries of Christ will not be able to resist; but if we choose aggression with the sword of invasion, we must fear lest we who fight with the sword perish by the sword. |
| 2 | Unde sola defensio sine periculo est Christiano. | Hence, only defense is without danger for a Christian. |
| 2 | Non est dubium medio principum temporalium, quos Teucri sacerdotibus praeferunt, ad colloquia posse perveniri, et ex illis furor mitigabitur et veritas se ipsam ostendet cum profectu fidei nostrae. | There is no doubt that through the mediation of temporal princes, whom the Turks prefer to priests, it is possible to reach discussions, and from these their fury will be mitigated and the truth will reveal itself to the benefit of our faith. |
| 2 | Verum quia in terris Sarracenorum reperiuntur multi zelosi fideles, qui et mores atque fundamenta eorum optime sciunt et semper student ipsis obviare, illos colligere ex Kayro, Alexandria et Caffa expediret, et mercatores modum haberent eos adducendi. | But since there are many zealous faithful found in the lands of the Saracens, who know their customs and foundations very well and always strive to oppose them, it would be expedient to gather them from Cairo, Alexandria, and Caffa, and merchants would have a way of bringing them. |
| 2 | Sunt etiam quidam religiosi nostri, qui habitant inter eos tam in Armenia quam Graecia; hii similiter audiendi essent ut maturo consilio haec res initiaretur. | There are also some of our religious who live among them, both in Armenia and Greece; these should likewise be heard so that this matter may be initiated with mature counsel. |
| 2 | Spes est quod omnes Teucri acquiescerent fidei sanctissimae Trinitatis ex rationibus tactis in scripto reverendissimae paternitatis vestrae, quas et alias Basileae audivi a vobis, quando mihi Richardum de Sancto Victore laudastis. | There is hope that all the Turks would acquiesce to the faith of the most holy Trinity from the reasons touched upon in the writing of your most reverend paternity, which I also heard from you elsewhere in Basel, when you praised Richard of St. Victor to me. |
| 2 | Possunt et plures aliae formari, quae ostenderent sufficienter fidem Trinitatis ad summam notitiam unius Dei accedere, in quo non potest natura summe perfecta videri uti in principio nisi correlationes divinae admittantur. | Many other arguments can also be formed, which would sufficiently show that the faith of the Trinity approaches the highest knowledge of the one God, in whom the supremely perfect nature cannot be seen as in the beginning unless divine correlations are admitted. |
| 2 | Expertus sum tam apud Iudaeos quam ipsos Teucros non esse difficile persuadere trinitatem in unitate substantiae. | I have found it not difficult to persuade both Jews and the Turks themselves of the Trinity in the unity of substance. |
| 2 | Sed circa unionem ypostaticam, in qua principaliter ultra unum Deum colentes nostra fides consistit, non minus difficile erit nunc quam semper ab initio. | But concerning the hypostatic union, in which our faith principally consists beyond the worship of one God, it will be no less difficult now than it has always been from the beginning. |
| 2 | Nam Fotinus et Paulus Samosatenus et ceteri qui Christum diviserunt, se fundantes in rationibus quomodo unio requirit proportionata – sed infiniti ad finitum nulla est proportio – et id ipsum allegarunt Paulum sensisse, qui divinitatem dixit inhabitare Christum per gratiam, modo quo et evangelium aiebat puerum crevisse [et defecisse] et profecisse <et> gratiam Dei fuisse in eo; quam tamen gratiam non negabant summam atque plenissimam, quia sic ait theologus Iohannes: plenum gratia. | For Photinus and Paul of Samosata and others who divided Christ, basing themselves on reasons of how union requires proportion—but there is no proportion between the infinite and the finite—and they themselves alleged that Paul meant this, who said that divinity dwelt in Christ through grace, in the way that the Gospel also said the boy grew [and failed] and advanced and the grace of God was in him; yet they did not deny that this grace was supreme and most full, for thus says the theologian John: full of grace. |
| 2 | Unde et ita Sarraceni fatentur Christum verbum et filium Dei et ruholla, hoc est spiritum Dei. | Hence, even the Saracens confess that Christ is the Word and Son of God and *ruhollah*, that is, the Spirit of God. |
| 2 | Ista pars erit, uti semper fuit, difficilis valde; quam non legi in hiis scriptis vestris nunc ad me missis elucidatam. | This part will be, as it has always been, very difficult; I have not read it elucidated in these writings of yours now sent to me. |
| 2 | Contuli aliquando cum certis, quibus dixi an ex Alchorano pateat aliquem Christo praeferri posse. | I once conferred with certain individuals, to whom I asked whether it is evident from the Quran that anyone can be preferred to Christ. |
| 2 | Qui respondebant non posse, quia ipse filius Dei altissimus. | They responded that it is not possible, because He is the Son of the Most High God. |
| 2 | Adieci: Sic saltem fatentur quod gratia illa, per quam est filius Dei, non potest esse maior. | I added: Thus they at least confess that the grace through which He is the Son of God cannot be greater. |
| 2 | Id autem quod non potest esse maius, etiam non potest esse minus, quia est infinitum; et omne id quod est infinitum, cum non possit esse aliter quam est, sed est omne id quod esse potest, est ipsa absoluta necessitas, quae Deus est. | But that which cannot be greater also cannot be less, because it is infinite; and everything that is infinite, since it cannot be otherwise than it is, but is everything that it can be, is itself absolute necessity, which is God. |
| 2 | Sic non est gratia, nam gratia non est necessitas. | Thus it is not grace, for grace is not necessity. |
| 2 | Unde infinita gratia, quae est adeo plena quod est absolute maxima quia maior esse nequit, ita est gratia quod natura. | Hence, infinite grace, which is so full that it is absolutely the greatest because it cannot be greater, is grace as much as nature. |
| 2 | Quare non est differentia nisi in modo loquendi inter verba quae illi dicunt de gratia et nos de natura. | Therefore, there is no difference except in the manner of speaking between the words they say about grace and we about nature. |
| 2 | Et visum est mihi tali modo posse persuaderi ipsis. | And it seemed to me that it could be persuaded to them in this way. |
| 2 | Et quando adiungeremus nos non ita asserere, ut nobis imponunt, Christum Deum, quasi id quod in Christo aliquo sensu attingi potuit esset ipsa deitas, quia naturae remanserunt inconfusae, per hoc intelligendo verba Mahometh vera quae de sensibili Christo loquitur, vel acquiescerent, vel saltim ostenderemus ex Alchorano ipsos non debere contra nos saevire, si illum mediatorem recte colimus quem ipsi tantum laudant. | And when we would add that we do not assert, as they impose upon us, that Christ is God, as if what in Christ could in some sense be attained were the very deity, because the natures remained unconfused, by this understanding the words of Muhammad true which speak of the sensible Christ, they would either acquiesce, or at least we would show from the Quran that they ought not to rage against us if we rightly worship that mediator whom they so greatly praise. |
| 2 | De paradiso potest de facili conclusio capi, etiam ex dictis suorum, maxime Avicennae, qui in Methaphisica sua praefert paradisum intellectualium deliciarum paradiso sensibilium in Alchorano descriptum. | Concerning paradise, a conclusion can easily be drawn, even from the sayings of their own, especially Avicenna, who in his *Metaphysics* prefers the paradise of intellectual delights to the paradise of sensible delights described in the Quran. |
| 2 | Etiam videtur scriptorem Alchorani locutum per similitudinem corporalium deliciarum de futuris deliciis. | It also seems that the writer of the Quran spoke through the likeness of bodily delights about future delights. |
| 2 | Nam post multas recitationes metse glosat dicens: ‘Ista et ista habebitis, hoc est omne bonum et quidquid desiderabitis. | For after many recitations, he glosses, saying: ‘This and that you shall have, that is, every good and whatever you desire.’ |
| 2 | ’ Unde videtur quod semper ad hoc conandum sit quod liber iste, qui apud eos est in auctoritate, pro nobis allegetur. | Hence, it seems that we should always strive to have this book, which is authoritative among them, be cited in our favor. |
| 2 | Nam reperimus in eo talia quae serviunt nobis; et alia quae contrariantur, glosabimus per illa. | For we find in it such things that serve us; and others that are contrary, we will gloss through those. |
| 2 | De cruce vero, quam abhominantur potius ob reverentiam Christi, quia in Alchoran nihil tangitur de ea, per mysteria et praeconia ipsos habunde informare poterimus, ut cesset opinio absurditatis. | Concerning the cross, which they abhor more out of reverence for Christ, since nothing is mentioned about it in the Quran, we can abundantly inform them through mysteries and proclamations, so that the opinion of absurdity may cease. |
| 2 | De sacramento eucharistiae erit difficultas maxima. | Concerning the sacrament of the Eucharist, there will be the greatest difficulty. |
| 2 | Sed quod fidelis expectans Verbo Dei immortaliter pasci habeat in hac peregrinatione eundem cibum modo quo convenit peregrinanti per fidem, est conveniens ut quod hic fide ibi re attingamus, ne in vacuum curramus aut in vago non habendo signa sub quibus lateat quod quaerimus. | But that the faithful, awaiting the Word of God to be fed immortally, should have in this pilgrimage the same food in a manner fitting to the pilgrim through faith, it is fitting that what we attain here by faith we may there attain in reality, lest we run in vain or wander aimlessly without having signs under which what we seek lies hidden. |
| 2 | Et quando clarioribus rationibus convenientia persuaderetur ac quod oculo fidei solum Deus et hic cibus videtur, quia non est de hoc mundo, non poterunt reprehendere nos, si quando motiva intellexerint. | And when the suitability is persuaded by clearer reasons and that only God and this food are seen by the eye of faith, because it is not of this world, they will not be able to reproach us, once they understand the motives. |
| 2 | Credunt enim ipsi quod nos masticemus Deum dentibus, etc. | For they believe that we chew God with our teeth, etc. |
| 2 | Ista ergo non informando doctissimum scripsi, sed occasionem praestando cogitandi; licet credam nihil restare quod non sit in opere digestum. | Therefore, I have written this not to instruct the most learned, but to provide an occasion for thought; though I believe nothing remains that has not been digested in the work. |
| 2 | Ego tamen, etsi omnino cum ipsis potius putem conferendum quam bellandum, laudarem quod sanctissimus dominus noster et rectores Ecclesiae convenirent et causam cur nobis Deus molestia factus sit inquirerent et providerent. | I, however, although I think it is better to confer with them rather than to wage war, would praise it if our most holy lord and the rulers of the Church would convene and inquire into the cause why God has become a burden to us and provide for it. |
| 2 | Nam pluries tepiditate Ecclesiam subintrante excitata sunt flagella. | For often when lukewarmness has entered the Church, scourges have been aroused. |
| 2 | Venerunt Romam aliquando Sarraceni et Ecclesiam sancti Petri depraedarunt; excitata dormiens Ecclesia ad Dominum habuit refugium. | Once Saracens came to Rome and plundered the Church of St. Peter; the sleeping Church, aroused, had refuge in the Lord. |
| 2 | Odit Deus tepiditatem, quia Deus zelotes. | God hates lukewarmness, because God is zealous. |
| 2 | Unde, si occasiones tollerentur quare contra nos sed pro nostra salute et decore Ecclesiae Christus ista permittit, esset infallibile remedium. | Hence, if the occasions were removed why Christ permits these things against us but for our salvation and the honor of the Church, it would be an infallible remedy. |
| 2 | Ego firmissime credo non ad mortem sed vitam, non ad suppressionem sed exaltationem fidei persecutionem permitti. | I most firmly believe that persecution is permitted not for death but for life, not for the suppression but for the exaltation of faith. |
| 2 | Ecclesia enim hoc proprium habet quod sub persecutione splendescit. | For the Church has this peculiarity that it shines under persecution. |
