| 123 | Coniectura de ultimis diebus Quamquam universus hic mundus a cunctipotentis voluntate dependeat, ita ut nemo hominum sensum domini noscere queat, cum nec ea quae in hominis sunt conceptu praeter hominis spiritum quisquam sciat, ac sic ad nos minime spectet temporis momenta, quae in patris maiestate posita sunt, diffinire, cum solum ibi omnia nobis futura intemporaliter sint praesentia, debeatque nos sanctimonia vitae et litterarum intelligentia prorsus patrum comparatione carentes maxime a futurorum curiali inquisitione retrahere eo, quod paene omnes, qui hactenus aliquid de temporum ratione scripserunt, fallaci quadam coniectura decepti sunt, tamen semota arrogantia pia atque aedificatoria investigatione ex sanctis litteris futura conicere, inquantum nostrae peregrinationi consolatoriam affert refectionem, non arbitror reprehensibile. | Although the entire world depends on the will of the all-powerful, so that no human can know the mind of the Lord, since no one knows the things that are in a human's concept except the human spirit, and thus the moments of time, which are placed in the majesty of the Father, do not pertain to us to define, since only there are all future things present to us in a timeless manner, and we, lacking the comparison of the fathers in sanctity of life and understanding of letters, ought to be withdrawn from the inquisitive investigation of the future by the fact that almost all who have written something about the reckoning of times up to this point have been deceived by a certain false conjecture, nevertheless, I do not think it reprehensible to conjecture about the future through a pious and edifying investigation from the holy letters, insofar as it brings a consolatory refreshment to our pilgrimage. |
| 123 | Nitimur etenim omni diligentia incomprehensibilem veritatem in hac vita cognoscere, quamvis in hoc mundo non absque aenigmatica figura infinite distanter a se ipsa uti est ipsam inapprehensibilem sciamus. | For we strive with all diligence to know the incomprehensible truth in this life, although we know that in this world it is not without an enigmatic figure, infinitely distant from itself, and thus it is inapprehensible. |
| 124 | Id autem, in quo Christianum quoad futurorum eventum quiescere convenit, arbitror unum solum esse. | But I think that there is only one thing in which it is fitting for a Christian to rest concerning the event of the future. |
| 124 | Non enim se Paulus ad tertium caelum raptus aliud inter sapientes scire aestimavit quam «Christum et hunc crucifixum», in quo aiebat omnia scitu possibilia quasi in thesauro sapientiae contineri. | For Paul, having been rapt to the third heaven, did not think that he knew anything among the wise except "Christ and him crucified," in whom he said that all things possible to be known are contained, as it were, in a treasure of wisdom. |
| 124 | Unde si Christianorum tempora in eo quod Christiani aliquantulum praevidere cupimus, recte ad Christi peregrinationem convertimur. | Whence, if we wish to foresee something of the times of the Christians, we rightly turn to the pilgrimage of Christ. |
| 124 | Sicut enim ipse nos docet, si Christianam vitam habere studemus, ab eo ipsam addiscere debemus, qui ait: «Discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde». | For as he himself teaches, if we wish to have the Christian life, we ought to learn it from him, who says: "Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart." |
| 124 | Sic et ipse exemplum nobis dedit, ut quemadmodum ipse fecit et nos, qui Christiani esse cupimus, similiter faciamus. | And thus he himself gave us an example, that just as he did, so also we, who wish to be Christians, should do likewise. |
| 124 | Ipse etiam nos instruit, quomodo omnes fideles eius membra sunt, quando ait id sibi fieri, quod minimo fit suorum. | He also instructs us that all the faithful are his members, when he says that what is done to the least of his own is done to him. |
| 124 | Est igitur ecclesia corpus eius mysticum, quae in universalitate sua caput suum Christum, «qui caelos penetravit», peregrinando quemadmodum et ipse, ascendendo sequitur. | Therefore, the church is the mystical body of Christ, which in its universality follows its head, Christ, "who has penetrated the heavens," by pilgrimaging, just as he himself did, by ascending. |
| 124 | Praecessit Christus ut exemplar, sequitur ecclesia ut imago veritatem. | Christ preceded as an exemplar, the church follows as an image of truth. |
| 125 | Vidit Moyses in monte in ostensione veritatis, quod postea evanescente visione successive explicavit. | Moses saw on the mountain in a manifestation of truth what he afterwards explained in a successive vision, which vanished. |
| 125 | Videtur homo depingendus brevi discursu «a pedis planta usque ad verticem», quem dum statuarius exsculpere satagit seriatim, temporis intervallo opus habet. | A human seems to be depicted in a brief discourse "from the sole of the foot to the top," which, while the sculptor strives to carve it out in sequence, requires an interval of time for the work. |
| 125 | Christus in hunc mundum puer intravit, crevit «sapientia et aetate», factus est vir docens veritatem et in ea ambulavit, quousque ob eius testimonium de mundo sublatus est. | Christ entered this world as a boy, grew "in wisdom and age," became a man teaching truth, and walked in it, until he was taken away from the world for the sake of his testimony. |
| 125 | Dimisit semen scilicet ecclesiam, in qua remansit ut Adam in Eva sponsa de eius carne et osse virago facta, ut ipsam sui seminis ecclesiam sibi sponsam in domum patris per assumptionem traducendam enutriret. | He sent forth the seed, namely the church, in which he remained, just as Adam in his spouse Eve, who was made from his flesh and bone, so that he might nourish his own seed, the church, as his spouse, to be led to the house of the Father through assumption. |
| 125 | Quae ut puer renata est in hoc mundo, crevit in aetate et sapientia et mundi peregrinationem complevit. | Which, reborn as a boy, grew in age and wisdom, and completed the pilgrimage of the world. |
| 126 | Unde cum ad veritatem exemplarem inspicere necesse sit, Christi peregrinationem in ecclesia explicari recte coniectamus. | Whence, when it is necessary to look at the exemplary truth, we rightly conjecture that the pilgrimage of Christ is explained in the church. |
| 126 | Dicit autem Christus se filium hominis et sabbati esse atque in ipso compleri, quod de anno domini, qui est iubilaeus seu libertatis, per Isaiam fuit prophetatum. | But Christ says that he is the son of man and the lord of the Sabbath, and that in him is fulfilled what was prophesied by Isaiah concerning the year of the Lord, which is the jubilee or the year of liberation. |
| 126 | Tempus igitur Christi est tempus deo sanctificatum, sabbatum scilicet, in quo est quies operum dei, sic et temporis. | Therefore, the time of Christ is the time sanctified by God, namely the Sabbath, in which there is rest from the works of God, and thus from time. |
| 126 | Non veniet igitur tempus aliud requiei, cum deus uti in maximo atque ultimo complemen to operum in Christo quiescat. | Therefore, another time of rest will not come, since God, as in the greatest and last complement of his works, rests in Christ. |
| 126 | Si igitur ad diem Christi inspicimus, dies eius est sabbati, si ad annum Christi, annus eius est sabbati, qui domini est annus seu iubilaeus. | If, therefore, we look to the day of Christ, his day is the Sabbath; if to the year of Christ, his year is the Sabbath, which is the year of the Lord, or the jubilee. |
| 127 | Omne enim tempus septenario revolvitur, septem scilicet diebus, septem annis et septies septem annis, qui sunt 49. | For all time revolves in a septenary, namely in seven days, seven years, and seven times seven years, which are 49. |
| 127 | Unde annus quinquagesimus est post laboriosam temporis revolutionem sabatissimus, in quo quiescit omnis servitus et redit in libertatem. | Whence the fiftieth year is the most sabbath-like after the laborious revolution of time, in which all servitude rests and returns to liberty. |
| 127 | Explicant autem annum unum domini 50 usuales. | But they explain one year of the Lord as 50 usual years. |
| 127 | Unde cum ecclesia sit Christum explicatorie sequens, qui est magister et dominus, annos ipsius domini complicatorie iubilaeos ipsa explicat per quinquaginta, ut uni solari revolutioni Christi, solis iustitiae, una anni domini revolutio in peregrinatione ecclesiae correspondeat. | Whence, since the church follows Christ in an explanatory manner, who is the master and lord, it explains the jubilees of the Lord in a complicated manner through 50, so that one revolution of the year of the Lord in the pilgrimage of the church corresponds to one solar revolution of Christ, the sun of justice. |
| 127 | Tali enim ratione conicimus plus quam quinque usque ad ecclesiae resurrectionem restare iubilaeos, et sic nos nunc annum XII iubilaei 28 agere, cum a Christi ascensione 1412 anni hoc tempore numerentur effluxi. | For we conjecture by such a reasoning that more than five jubilees remain until the resurrection of the church, and thus we are now in the 28th year of the 12th jubilee, since 1412 years have flowed from the ascension of Christ to this time. |
| 128 | Erat autem Iohannes Baptista tunc in deserto baptizans et lavans in doctrinae verbo peccatorum sordes, ut pararet «domino plebem perfectam». | But John the Baptist was then in the desert, baptizing and washing away the filth of sins with the word of doctrine, so that he might prepare "a perfect people for the Lord." |
| 128 | In tali enim spiritu Eliae, in quo ipse «testimonium perhibuit» luci veritatis, scilicet Christo, surgere in proximo debere credimus eiusdem spiritus discipulos et in ipsis Eliam se verbo doctrinae ostensurum, qui digito ostendent mundo Christum et veritatem vitae et iustitiae. | For we believe that in such a spirit of Elijah, in which he himself "bore witness" to the light of truth, namely Christ, the disciples of the same spirit will arise in the near future and in them Elijah will show himself by the word of doctrine, who will point out Christ and the truth of life and justice to the world with their finger. |
| 128 | Et Christi corpus, scilicet ipsam ecclesiam, lavabunt, ita ut spiritus dei in ipsam quasi visibiliter ut super Christum descendat in specie columbinae simplicitatis. | And they will wash the body of Christ, namely the church itself, so that the spirit of God may descend into it, as it were visibly, in the likeness of a dove's simplicity, just as it did over Christ. |
| 129 | Et tunc dabunt se sancti aliqui longae macerationi se a mundo separantes et temptatori victo redibunt verbum vitae seminaturi. | And then some saints will give themselves to long maceration, separating themselves from the world, and having conquered the tempter, they will return to sow the word of life. |
| 129 | Tunc et mira operabuntur in spiritu Christi. | Then they will work miracles in the spirit of Christ. |
| 129 | Etiam persecutionem patietur spiritus rigoris Eliae in prioribus ipsis praedicatoribus uti in Iohanne, quoniam illecebritas fornicaria huius mundi, quae fuit causa necis Iohannis, non patietur illos vivere. | Also, the spirit of the rigor of Elijah will suffer persecution in those preachers, just as in John, because the fornicating allurements of this world, which were the cause of John's death, will not allow them to live. |
| 129 | Sed augebitur continue numerus fidelium et dilatabitur luce doctrinae successive usque ad iubilaeum 34. | But the number of the faithful will continually increase, and the light of doctrine will be successively expanded until the 34th jubilee. |
| 129 | Et fient in ipsa «signa et prodigia» explicatoria historiae vitae Christi in evangeliis tradita, et non erit habitatio in mundo expers notitiae Christi et fidei. | And there will be "signs and prodigies" in it, which are explanatory of the history of the life of Christ, handed down in the Gospels, and there will not be a dwelling in the world without knowledge of Christ and faith. |
| 130 | Post haec Antichristi satanicus spiritus persecutionem concitabit contra corpus Christi «quod est ecclesia». | After these things, the satanic spirit of Antichrist will stir up persecution against the body of Christ, "which is the church." |
| 130 | Et erit tribulatio ultima, qua numquam alia maior fuit, quae est explicatoria historiae passionis Christi. | And there will be a final tribulation, such as never was before, which is explanatory of the history of the passion of Christ. |
| 130 | Et videbitur ipsa ecclesia extingui, quia sancti apostoli, satores verbi dei, eam deserent et fugient. | And the church itself will seem to be extinguished, because the holy apostles, the sowers of the word of God, will desert it and flee. |
| 130 | Nec stabit Petri aut cuiuscumque apostoli successor. | Nor will the successor of Peter or any apostle stand firm. |
| 130 | Omnes scandalum patientur. | All will suffer scandal. |
| 131 | Et quando sic oculis insipientum Christi corpus creditur ignominiose quasi per crucis mortem de mundo sublatum, resument sancti vires et revertentur ad cor, quia videbunt ecclesiam post sanctorum interemptionem gloriosiori fulgore resurgere post paucos dies. | And when thus the body of Christ is believed to be ignominiously taken away from the world, as it were through the death of the cross, the saints will resume their strength and return to the heart, because they will see the church resurge with more glorious splendor after the interemption of the saints, after a few days. |
| 131 | Et videntes infideles Antichristiani praevaluisse ecclesiam et se victos victori Christo cedent. | And the unbelievers, seeing that the Antichristians have prevailed over the church and that they themselves have been conquered, will yield to the victorious Christ. |
| 131 | Et ad ipsum revertentur omnes nationes, ut sit Christi hereditas in universo orbe unum ovile unius pastoris. | And all nations will turn to him, so that the heritage of Christ may be one fold of one shepherd in the entire world. |
| 131 | Et flebit Petrus amare, quia fugit. | And Peter will weep bitterly, because he fled. |
| 131 | Sic et ceteri apostoli, scilicet ecclesiae episcopi et sacerdotes. | So also the other apostles, namely the bishops and priests of the church. |
| 131 | Et dabitur ipsis locus paenitentiae. | And a place of penitence will be given to them. |
| 131 | Et reddet se ecclesia gloriosa resurrectione a pressura Antichristiana ostensibilem omnibus dubitantibus, ut omnes, qui dubii fuerunt de veritate vitae, quae est in Christo sponso ecclesiae, testes fiant gloriosae resurrectionis etiam in sanguine suo, si opus foret. | And the church will show itself glorious in resurrection, visible to all who doubt, so that all who have doubted the truth of life, which is in Christ, the spouse of the church, may become witnesses of the glorious resurrection, even in their own blood, if necessary. |
| 132 | Et incipiet ecclesia in tranquillitate de aeterna pace meditari et amplexum sponsi appetere in gloria per transcensum mundi sensibilis. | And the church will begin to meditate on eternal peace in tranquility and to desire the embrace of the spouse in glory, having transcended the sensible world. |
| 132 | Sed mundi statim finis, ut reddatur sponsa absque omni ruga et macula digna sponso, qui est agnus sine macula. | But the end of the world will come immediately, so that the spouse may be rendered without any wrinkle or spot, worthy of the spouse, who is the lamb without spot. |
| 132 | Et veniet tunc iudicaturus «vivos et mortuos et saeculum per ignem». | And he will come then to judge "the living and the dead and the world through fire." |
| 132 | Et assumet «in gloriam suam» sponsam secum aeternaliter regnaturam. | And he will take "in his glory" the spouse to reign with him eternally. |
| 133 | Poterit quisque ex evangelicis descriptionibus particularius coniecturas istas explicare. | Each person will be able to explain these conjectures in more detail from the evangelical descriptions. |
| 133 | Et hinc de hoc nunc satis sit. | And from this point, it is enough for now. |
| 133 | Hoc solum absque temerario iudicio, ut Christianus, coniciens, quod in his, quae Christus egit et circa Christum acta sunt post 28 annum usque in diem resurrectionis a morte, annum unum domini in iubilaeum extendendo poterit quisque verisimilius, quid futurum sit in ecclesia, praevidere, ut sic in 34 iubilaeo a resurrectione Christi resurrectionem ecclesiae depulso Antichristo speret dei pietate victoriose futuram. | This alone, without rash judgment, as a Christian, I conjecture, that in those things which Christ did and which were done around Christ from the 28th year until the day of resurrection from death, by extending one year of the Lord into a jubilee, anyone can more plausibly foresee what will happen in the church, so that in this way, in the 34th jubilee from the resurrection of Christ, I hope for the resurrection of the church, with the Antichrist having been vanquished, to be victorious by the piety of God. |
| 133 | Et hoc erit post annum nativitatis 1700 ante annum 1734. | And this will be after the year 1700 from the birth, before the year 1734. |
| 133 | Post illud autem tempus ascensio ecclesiae futura est Christo sponso ad iudicium veniente. | After that time, however, the ascension of the church will be future, with Christ the bridegroom coming to judgment. |
| 133 | Sed quando veniet, nemo sciet. | But when he will come, no one will know. |
| 133 | Erit enim ille adventus ita omnibus ante incognitus quoad temporis praecisionem, sicut adventus eius in mundum fuit in temporis praecisione omnibus ignotus. | For his advent will be so unknown to all beforehand, as far as the precision of time is concerned, just as his advent into the world was unknown to all in the precision of time. |
| 134 | Tunc sancti scientes, quia «veniet et non tardabit», orabunt, ut veniat desideratus omnibus gentibus dicentes: quoniam vicisti domine et sedisti a dextris patris, donec pater ipse poneret inimicos tuos sub pedibus tuis et «terminos terrae possessionem tuam». | Then the saints, knowing that "he will come and not delay", will pray that the desired one come to all nations, saying: for you have conquered, Lord, and sat at the right hand of the Father, until the Father himself puts your enemies under your feet, and "the ends of the earth are your possession". |
| 134 | Hinc nunc, domine, veni et transfer possessionem tuam in gloriam. | From now on, Lord, come and transfer your possession into glory. |
| 134 | Talia quidem dicent scientes post longanimitatem exspectationis appropinquare diem redemptionis. | Such things, indeed, they will say, knowing that after long-suffering expectation, the day of redemption is approaching. |
| 134 | Qui veniet sine signo in nocte «tamquam fur», sicuti venit diluvium, uti fatetur ipse Christus. | He who will come without a sign in the night "like a thief", just as the flood came, as Christ himself confesses. |
| 135 | Haec autem supputatio resurrectionis Christi in corpore suo «quod est ecclesia» multis rationibus aliorum considerationibus verior forte ex eo conicitur, quia Christus docuit in persecutione sua ecclesiam documentum suae persecutionis capere debere dicens: «Si me persecuti fuerint et vos persequentur», ac quod ipse, quamvis abire videretur post resurrectionem, in ecclesia remansurus et peregrinaturus esset usque ad consummationem saeculi, praedixitque oppressionem ecclesiae ante eius gloriosam resurrectionem, qua maior nulla fuit, in ultimis diebus venturam, sicut et in ultimis diebus carnis suae secum actum est, atque ad duo nos remisit, scilicet ad similitudinem diluvii atque ad dictum Danielis prophetae. | This calculation of the resurrection of Christ in his body, "which is the church", is perhaps more true for many reasons and considerations of others, because Christ taught in his persecution that the church ought to take a lesson from his persecution, saying: "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you", and that he, although he seemed to depart after his resurrection, would remain and be a pilgrim in the church until the end of the age, and he predicted the oppression of the church before its glorious resurrection, which was greater than none, to come in the last days, just as it was done with him in the last days of his flesh, and he sent us to two things, namely to the likeness of the flood and to the saying of the prophet Daniel. |
| 136 | Unde cum Christus sit ipse secundus Adam, tunc uti post primum Adam venit in 34 iubilaeo secundum doctissimum atque sapientissimum Philonem, cui liber Sapientiae ascribitur, in libro Historiarum consumptio peccati per aquam diluvii in diebus Noe, ita conicimus, quod post secundum Adam in 34 iubilaeo veniet consumptio peccati per ignem spiritus domini. | Whence, since Christ is the second Adam, then, just as after the first Adam, the consumption of sin through the water of the flood came in the 34th jubilee, according to the most learned and wisest Philo, to whom the book of Wisdom is ascribed, in the book of Histories, so we conjecture that after the second Adam, in the 34th jubilee, the consumption of sin through the fire of the spirit of the Lord will come. |
| 137 | Similiter Danieli apertum fuit, quomodo novissima maledictio futura foret, post quam sanctuarium mundificabitur et visio implebitur et hoc post 2300 dies ab hora egressionis verbi. | Similarly, it was revealed to Daniel how the last curse would be, after which the sanctuary will be purified and the vision will be fulfilled, and this after 2300 days from the hour of the going forth of the word. |
| 137 | Unde cum anno tertio Balthasar regis haec revelatio sibi facta sit primo anno Cyri regis Persarum, qui Christum secundum Hieronymum, Africanum et Iosephum circa 559 annos praecessit, tunc constat resurrectionem ecclesiae secundum numerum praefatum diem in annum resolvendo iuxta apertionem Ezechieli factam post annum Christi 1700 et ante 1750 futuram. | Whence, since this revelation was made to him in the third year of King Balthasar, in the first year of King Cyrus of the Persians, who, according to Jerome, Africanus, and Josephus, preceded Christ by about 559 years, then it is established that the resurrection of the church, according to the aforementioned number, resolving the day into the year, according to the revelation made by Ezekiel, after the year of Christ 1700 and before 1750, will be future. |
| 137 | Quod concordat praemissis. | Which agrees with the premises. |
| 138 | Refert Philo in Historiis Moysen in ultimis deum interrogasse, quantum tempus transisset et quantum superesset. | Philo reports in the Histories that Moses, in the last days, asked God how much time had passed and how much remained. |
| 138 | Cui deus respondit: Quattuor enim, semis transiit, duo semis supersunt. | To whom God responded: For four and a half have passed, and two and a half remain. |
| 138 | Et Moyses impletus est sensu et obiit. | And Moses was filled with understanding and died. |
| 138 | Unde deus secundum ista Moysi aperuit quattuor tempora, duo de illis transisse et duo superesse. | Whence God, according to these things, revealed to Moses four times, two of which have passed and two remain. |
| 138 | Transiit igitur ab Adam usque in diluvium tempus unum. | Therefore, the time from Adam to the flood has passed, one time. |
| 138 | Igitur secundum a diluvio ad ipsum, tertium ab ipso ad Christum, quartum de Christo ad finem. | Then, the second from the flood to him, the third from him to Christ, the fourth from Christ to the end. |
| 138 | Incepit igitur ultima quarta in Christi resurrectione, et ob hoc sancti saepe hoc tempus novissimum et finem saeculorum nominant. | Therefore, the last fourth began with the resurrection of Christ, and on account of this, the saints often call this time the last and the end of the ages. |
| 139 | Et quamvis computationes annorum sint multum variae secundum Iudaicam veritatem, secundum 70 interpretes, secundum Iosephum et Philonem, tamen istud verius puto, quod scilicet tot anni iubilaei a Moysi morte usque in Christum fluxerunt, quot ab Adam usque ad dies illos Noe, et quod tot a diebus diluvii sub Noe usque ad mortem Moysi, atque quod et tot fluent a Christo usque ad complementum ultimi quaternarii annorum 34 iubilaeorum, ut sic Moyses mortuus sit secundum hanc divinam revelationem in medio temporis quaternarii duabus quaternarii partibus completis. | And although the computations of years are very varied according to Jewish truth, according to the 70 interpreters, according to Josephus and Philo, nevertheless I think this is more true, that namely as many years of jubilees flowed from the death of Moses to Christ, as from Adam to those days of Noah, and that as many flowed from the days of the flood under Noah to the death of Moses, and that as many will flow from Christ to the completion of the last quaternary of 34 jubilees, so that Moses died, according to this divine revelation, in the middle of the quaternary time, with two parts of the quaternary completed. |
| 140 | Multa alia de hac re scripta reperiuntur. | Many other things are written about this matter. |
| 140 | Multi enim se in istis fatigarunt, quos varia consideratio ad varias duxit opiniones, ut quisque suo sensu abundet et nemo cum alio consentiat. | For many have labored in these things, whom various considerations have led to various opinions, so that each one abounds in his own sense and no one agrees with another. |
| 140 | Suntque iam effluxa plura tempora, quae docti etiam viri non putarunt futura, et transierunt sic plurimi et transibunt in varietate interpretationis prophetiae Danielis. | And already many times have passed, which even learned men did not think would come, and many have passed and will pass in the variety of interpretation of the prophecy of Daniel. |
| 140 | Ego eorum scripta diligenter perquaesivi et nihil in illis de hac praemissa consideratione annotatum inveni. | I have diligently sought out their writings and found nothing noted in them concerning this aforementioned consideration. |
| 140 | Quare ipsam ad preces devoti cuiusdam sacerdotis sub omni correctione scriptis mandavi aliud non asserens, nisi quod in dei «manu sunt omnes fines terrae», cuius licet consilium est ab oculis omnium quantumcumque sapientum absconditum. | Wherefore I have committed it to writing, at the prayers of a certain devoted priest, under all correction, asserting nothing else, except that "in the hand of God are all the ends of the earth", whose counsel is hidden from the eyes of all, however wise, as much as possible. |
| 140 | Tamen eius tanta est benignitas, quod nos vermiculos sinit de sibi tantum notis aenigmaticas facere coniecturas, quas, uti maiestati suae placet, aut aliquas suo dono aut sine eo vanas ostendit, ut ab eo solo sit omnis sapientia, qui est in saeculum benedictus. | Nevertheless, his benignity is so great that he allows us, worms, to make conjectures, enigmatic to him alone, which, as it pleases his majesty, he either shows to be true by his gift or vain, so that all wisdom is from him alone, who is blessed forever. |
