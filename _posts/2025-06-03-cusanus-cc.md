| 1 | Iesus Praefatio in collectionem Nicolai de Cusa de catholica concordantia. | Jesus' Preface to Nicholas of Cusa's *De catholica concordantia*. |
| 1 | Exposcunt agitata sacri huius Basiliensis concilii, quae forte novitate quadam facile apud eos, qui modernioribus scribentibus indubiam fidem in voluntariis praebent, diiudicarentur, aliqua peritiora veterum ingenia vetustate iamdudum abolita ob eorum, qui hoc aevo dies graves ad finem ducunt, et priscorum illuminatissimorum naturam disparem palam facere. | The matters debated at this sacred Council of Basel demand discussion, which perhaps, due to a certain novelty, might easily be judged by those who give unquestioning credence to more recent writers, while more expert minds of old, long since rendered obsolete by the passage of time, might reveal a nature quite different from that of those who are now bringing these weighty days to a close, and illuminate the nature of the ancients. |
| 1 | Et eo haec res dissonantior videtur, quo minus a teneris annis imbibita minusque praevisa quodam excitativo superno influxu ex conquassatione ingeniorum ob exortam discordiam diffinita est. | And this matter seems all the more discordant, the less it has been imbibed from tender years and the less it has been foreseen by some divinely inspired influence, defined by a shaking of minds due to the discord that arose. |
| 2 | Quis, rogo, ante hos pauculos annos ea dixisse absque nota potuisset, quae nunc fieri conspeximus ad manifestandam universaliorum conciliorum eminentissimam potestatem, quae dudum non sine maximo publicae utilitatis ac fidei orthodoxae dispendio dormitavit? | Who, I ask, a few years ago could have spoken of those things which we have now seen come to pass to manifest the eminent power of ecumenical councils, which for a long time slept, not without the greatest loss to the common good and orthodox faith? |
| 2 | Videmus autem per cuncta ingenia etiam studiosissimorum omnium liberalium ac mechanicarum artium vetera repeti, et avidissime quidem, ac si totius revolutionis circulus proximo compleri spectaretur, resumimus non tantum graves sententiosos auctores, verum et eloquio et stilo et forma litterarum antiqua videmus omnes delectari, maxime quidem Italos, qui non satiantur disertissimo, ut natura Latini sunt, huius generis litterali eloquio, sed primorum vestigia petentes Graecis litteris maximum etiam studium impendunt. | We see, however, that throughout all fields of study, even among the most studious of all the liberal and mechanical arts, ancient things are being sought out again, and indeed eagerly, as if the whole cycle of revolution were about to be completed; we resume not only weighty and sententious authors, but we see everyone delighting in ancient eloquence, style, and form of letters, especially the Italians, who, being by nature Latin speakers, are not satisfied with the most eloquent literary style of this kind, but, seeking the earliest traces, devote the greatest study to Greek literature. |
| 2 | Nos vero Alemanni, etiamsi non longe aliis ingenio minores ex discrepanti stellarum situ essemus effecti, tamen in ipso suavissimo eloquii usu aliis plerumque non nostro cedimus vitio, cum non nisi labore maximo tamquam resistenti naturae vim facientes Latinum recte fari valemus. | We Alemanni, even if we were made somewhat less sharp-witted than others by an unfavorable stellar configuration, nevertheless, in the very use of most pleasing eloquence, usually do not yield to others through any fault of our own, since we are only able to speak Latin correctly by exerting the greatest effort, as if overcoming the resistance of nature. |
| 2 | Non admirentur itaque nationes ceterae, si infrascripta testimonia certorum inauditorum legerint. | Let other nations therefore not be surprised if they read the following testimonies of certain unheard-of things. |
| 2 | Originalia enim multa longo ab usu perdita per veterum coenobiorum armaria non sine magna diligentia collegi. | For many original documents, lost through long disuse, I have collected from the archives of ancient monasteries, not without great diligence. |
| 2 | Credant igitur, qui legerint, quia omnia ex antiquis originalibus, non ex cuiusquam abbreviata collectione, huc attracta sunt. | Let those who read therefore believe that all things have been drawn from ancient originals, not from anyone's abridged collection. |
| 2 | Non retrahat, rogo, quemquam a legendo incultus stilus. | Let no one, I pray, be deterred from reading by the unpolished style. |
| 2 | Apertus enim absque fuco clarissimus sensus humiliori eloquio, et si non avidius, facilius tamen capitur. | For the very clear sense, expressed without artifice in humble language, is grasped more easily, if not more eagerly. |
| 2 | Verum etsi omnibus placere vellem hanc collectionem, maxime tamen in hoc sacro concilio constitutis et tibi in primis, invictissimo a deo coronato imperator<i> nostro, Sigismundo ac etiam praedigno cardinali Iuliano, nostrae nationis mansuetissimo legato. | But although I would wish this collection to please everyone, yet most especially those assembled in this sacred council, and to you above all, our most invincible emperor, crowned by God, Sigismund, and also to the most worthy Cardinal Julian, the most gentle legate of our nation. |
| 2 | Si quidem tantae et excelsae utriusque potestatis approbatorium iudicium patesceret, nemo sic laudata recte spernere posset. | If indeed the approving judgment of such great and exalted power were to become manifest, no one could rightly scorn what is thus praised. |
| 3 | De catholica concordantia tractaturus investigare necesse habeo ipsam unionem fidelis populi, quae ecclesia catholica dicitur, et illius ecclesiae partes unitas, silicet animam et corpus. | In treating of Catholic concord, I must investigate the very union of the faithful people, which is called the Catholic Church, and the united parts of that Church, namely, its soul and body. |
| 3 | Unde erit prima consideratio de toto composito, scilicet ipsa ecclesia, secunda de anima ipsius, scilicet sacratissimo sacerdotio, tertia de corpore, scilicet sacro imperio. | Hence, the first consideration will be of the whole composite, namely, the Church itself; the second, of its soul, namely, the most sacred priesthood; the third, of its body, namely, the Holy Roman Empire. |
| 3 | Et in qualibet investigabo ex antiquis approbatis litteris, quae fuerint necessaria ad intelligendum subsistentiam, naturam, compagines et iuncturas cum membris, ut sic dulcis harmonica concordantia sciri possit, per quam salus aeterna et rei publicae terrenae consistit. | And in each I shall investigate from ancient and approved writings what was necessary for understanding its subsistence, nature, composition, and connections with its members, so that the sweet harmonious concordance may thus be known, through which eternal salvation and the well-being of earthly society consist. |

| R1 | Et ibi, quomodo graduative quodammodo usque in Christum successive in maiori lumine sanctitatis et veritatis apparuerunt membra Christi et sic descensive usque in finem, et quod paradisus regnum ecclesiae significet. | And there, how the members of Christ appeared gradually, in a certain way, successively in greater light of holiness and truth, even unto Christ, and thus descending to the end, and that paradise signifies the kingdom of the Church. |
| R1 | Cap. | Chap. |
| R1 | IV. | IV. |
| R1 | Quod, licet ecclesia triplex sit, triumphans, dormiens et militans, tamen ipsa militans varie consideratur, vel pro traducenda in triumphantem patriam, et sic est praedestinatorum, vel deo in praesenti tempore per fidem et caritatem unitorum, vel per fidem tantum. | That, although the Church is threefold—triumphant, sleeping, and militant—nevertheless, the militant Church is considered variously, either as being translated to the triumphant homeland, and thus it is of the predestined, or of those united to God in the present time through faith and charity, or through faith alone. |
| R1 | Et quomodo sit similis exercitui et aliis exemplis proportionetur, et est capitulum notandum valens pro evacuatione multorum dubiorum et reductione errantium. | And how it is similar to an army and is compared to other examples, and this is a noteworthy chapter, valuable for the resolution of many doubts and the reclaiming of the errant. |

| R1 | Et quod militans triumphanti subordinatur, quoniam ex sacramentis, sacerdotio et populo catholico connectitur. | And that the militant Church is subordinate to the triumphant, because it is connected through the sacraments, the priesthood, and the Catholic people. |
| R1 | Sacramenta subalternantur deo, sacerdotium ministris, scilicet angelis, populus beatis animabus. | The sacraments are subordinate to God, the priesthood to the ministers, namely, the angels, the people to the blessed souls. |
| R1 | Et de ipsa colligantia subalternali, quomodo sacerdotium coniungitur per sacramenta, quae deo proxima sunt, Christo, populus sacramentis per sacerdotium, et de graduatione cuiuslibet partis, et quomodo in qualibet parte supremus hierarcha in se repraesentative inferiora comprehendit. | And concerning this subordinate connection, how the priesthood is joined through the sacraments, which are closest to God, to Christ, the people to the sacraments through the priesthood, and concerning the gradation of each part, and how in each part the supreme hierarch comprehends the lower parts representatively in himself. |

| R2 | VIII. | VIII. |

| R2 | Cap. | Chap. |
| R2 | IX. | IX. |
| R2 | Quod, sicut sacerdotium subalternatur deo, ita praesidentialitas angelis. | That, just as the priesthood is subordinate to God, so presidency is to the angels. |

| R2 | Et sic est sacerdotium ut anima una in uno corpore fidelium. | And thus the priesthood is as one soul in one body of the faithful. |
| R2 | Et est valde mente tenendum illud parvum capitulum, maxime ubi epilogat et subinfert. | And this little chapter is to be held very much in mind, especially where it concludes and adds. |

| R4 | I. | I. |

| R4 | Alioquin, si rite non celebratur, errare potest et etiam ab ipso ad aliud appellare, et multa ibi, quae singulariter notanda. | Otherwise, if it is not celebrated rightly, it can err and even appeal from it to another, and many things there, which are singularly noteworthy. |
| R4 | Cap. | Chapter. |

| R5 | Et primo: Cap. | And first: Chapter. |
| R5 | VII. | VII. |
| R5 | Quod aliquando concilium multarum provinciarum, aliquando occidentale, et quod omnia etiam cum legato papae celebrata praeter concilia universalis ecclesiae dicuntur, sicut sunt, provincialia seu localia, licet dicantur vel generalia vel universalia aliquando etiam papa in eis praesidente. | That sometimes a council of many provinces, sometimes a western one, and that all even celebrated with the legate of the pope are called, as they are, provincial or local, although they are sometimes called general or universal, even with the pope presiding in them. |
| R5 | Et quod dicantur patriarchalia. | And that they are called patriarchal. |
| R5 | Et ibi de concilio generali vel universali Romanae ecclesiae aut papae, quomodo solum sit in certis regionibus patriarchali sedi subiectis collocatum, et in quibus, et quomodo hoc subest papae, et quantae auctoritatis exsistat et alia utilia de congregatione et subscriptione. | And there concerning the general or universal council of the Roman Church or the pope, how it is only placed in certain regions subject to the patriarchal seat, and in which, and how this is subject to the pope, and of what authority it exists, and other useful things concerning the congregation and subscription. |

| R5 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R5 | IX. | IX. |
| R5 | Quod nulla constitutio canonica sit efficax, nisi ex consensu expresso vel tacito aut nisi secundum aliquam canonicam facta fuerit. | That no canonical constitution is effective unless from express or tacit consent or unless it is made according to some canon. |

| R5 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R5 | X. | X. |
| R5 | Quod statuta etiam generalia non ligant aliquando particulares provincias, nisi acceptentur, et quod vigor statutorum ex acceptatione per usum vel consensum potius dependet, et quod ideo proprie solum sunt constitutiones, quae synodice promulgantur. | That even general statutes do not bind particular provinces unless they are accepted, and that the vigor of statutes depends rather on acceptance through use or consent, and that therefore only those are properly constitutions which are promulgated synodically. |

| R5 | Et propter hoc recte synodicae constitutiones sunt maximae efficaciae, et ibi causa redditur, et insuper iura, quae de decretalibus apostolicae sedis loquuntur, de synodice aut secundum canones decretis intelligi debent. | And for this reason synodical constitutions are of the greatest efficacy, and there the cause is given, and moreover the laws which speak of the decretals of the apostolic see must be understood concerning synodical or according to canonical decrees. |
| R5 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R5 | XII. | XII. |
| R5 | Quod ex consensu vigor statutorum dependeat, probatur per vim, quae consuetudini inest, et quod praesidentia papae in concilio universali quoad potestatem condendi recte aequiparetur praesidentiae metropolitani in provinciali concilio. | That the vigor of statutes depends on consent is proven by the force which is in custom, and that the presidency of the pope in a universal council as to the power of constituting is rightly equated to the presidency of the metropolitan in a provincial council. |
| R5 | Et ideo papa semper quasi apud antiquos archiepiscopus nominatur. | And therefore the pope is always called as it were an archbishop among the ancients. |
| R6 | Post haec examinatur difficultas praetacta ex argumentis, quae fieri possent a papa iurisdictionem omnem et statutorum vigorem dependere. | After this, the aforementioned difficulty is examined from arguments which could be made that all jurisdiction and the vigor of statutes depend on the pope. |
| R6 | Et primo: Cap. | And first: Chapter. |
| R6 | XIII. | XIII. |
| R6 | Quod argumenta omnia, quae dicunt papam habere potestatis plenitudinem a deo et consimilia, non obstant. | That all arguments which say that the pope has the fullness of power from God and similar things do not hinder. |
| R6 | Et ibi late de hoc. | And there at length concerning this. |
| R6 | Et quomodo constituatur administratio superiorum ex subiectione inferiorum, ex quo evenit potestatem superiorum etiam ab inferioribus dependere. | And how the administration of superiors is constituted from the subjection of inferiors, from which it happens that the power of superiors also depends on inferiors. |
| R6 | Et est nota dignum. | And it is worthy of note. |
| R6 | Et quod papalis administratio non habet alia principia quam episcopalis. | And that papal administration has no other principles than episcopal. |
| R6 | Quoniam omnis ecclesiasticae potestatis administratio desursum et deorsum constituitur, quoniam mediator est ipse pastor inter deum et gregem, et evacuantur omnia argumenta secundum ordinem per longum processum. | Since the administration of all ecclesiastical power is constituted from above and below, since the pastor himself is the mediator between God and the flock, and all arguments are evacuated according to order through a long process. |
| R6 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R6 | XIV. | XIV. |
| R6 | Quod omnis constitutio ex radice naturalis iuris locum habet, et quod omnis coerctio, cum natura aeque liberi simus, ex electione et consensu subiectorum sit, et quod iurisdictio creata ex se non habet potestatem nisi secundum legem et canonem, et est pulchra speculatio. | That every constitution has its place from the root of natural law, and that all coercion, since we are equally free by nature, is from the election and consent of the subjects, and that created jurisdiction does not have power in itself except according to law and canon, and it is a beautiful speculation. |
| R6 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R6 | XV. | XV. |
| R6 | Quod ex fundamentis praetactis, sicut episcopus sine capitulo et metropolitanus sine suffraganeis, ita et papa sine cardinalibus universalia statuta omnes subiectos tangentia facere non debeat, et quod ideo nullius iudicium absque auctoritate apostolicae sedis ratum, quia ab omnibus diffinitionibus etiam synodicis, excepta universali universalis ecclesiae synodo, ad ipsam Romanam sedem appellatum invenitur. | That from the aforementioned foundations, just as a bishop without a chapter and a metropolitan without suffragans, so also the pope without cardinals should not make universal statutes touching all subjects, and that therefore no judgment is ratified without the authority of the apostolic see, because from all definitions, even synodical, except the universal synod of the universal Church, appeal is found to the Roman see itself. |
| R6 | Et ibi, quomodo hoc commune dictum intelligi debeat. | And there, how this common saying should be understood. |
| R7 | Deinde cognito, quod ex consensu firmitas synodica dependet, videndum, qui interesse debeant. | Next, since the strength of a synod depends on consensus, it must be determined who ought to be present. |
| R7 | Et ibi: Cap. | And there: Chapter. |
| R7 | XVI. | XVI. |
| R7 | Quomodo ex diffinitivis subscriptionibus deprehenditur episcopos diffinitores, alios etiam consensum praestare et subscribere, abbates et monachos, laicos vero tamquam auditores et testes. | How it is discovered from definitive subscriptions that bishops are definers, and others also give their consent and subscribe, abbots and monks, while laymen are present as auditors and witnesses. |
| R7 | Et quod periti clerici etiam administratione carentes non debeant a conciliis pelli. | And that skilled clerics, even those lacking administration, ought not to be driven away from councils. |
| R8 | Consequenter de potestate universalis concilii tractatus subnectitur. | Consequently, a treatise on the power of a universal council is appended. |
| R8 | Et primo: Cap. | And first: Chapter. |
| R8 | XVII. | XVII. |
| R8 | Quod patriarchale concilium non est regulariter supra papam, sed ei subest, nisi erret in fide. | That a patriarchal council is not regularly above the pope, but is subject to him, unless he errs in faith. |
| R8 | Tamen eum reformare potest, sicut et metropolitanum provinciale. | Nevertheless, it can reform him, just as a metropolitan provincial council can. |
| R8 | Et quod universalis ecclesiae synodus non tantum supra papam, sed etiam eius et omnium aliorum patriarcharum synodos exsistit simpliciter. | And that a synod of the universal church exists not only above the pope but also simply above the synods of him and all other patriarchs. |
| R8 | Et evacuatur argumentum illud, quod communiter obicitur, Romanam sedem privilegio Christi toti ecclesiae supereminere, et quod universale concilium salvo illo privilegio in sedentem in sede, dum sua abutitur potestate, pro bono universalis ecclesiae iurisdictionem et superioritatem habet, et exempla ponuntur. | And that argument, commonly raised, that the Roman See, by the privilege of Christ, surpasses the entire church, and that a universal council, while preserving that privilege, possesses jurisdiction and superiority over him who sits on the throne, provided he abuses his power, for the good of the universal church, is refuted, and examples are given. |
| R8 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R8 | XVIII. | XVIII. |
| R8 | Quod fundamentum huius considerationis maioritatis concilii supra papam est secundum Augustinum, quia certior et infallibilior est repraesentatio ecclesiae, cui veritas et assistentia est promissa, in universali concilio quam in papa tantum. | That the foundation of this consideration of the council's superiority over the pope is, according to Augustine, because the representation of the church, to which truth and assistance are promised, is more certain and infallible in a universal council than in the pope alone. |
| R8 | Et ibi aperitur fundamentum totius materiae repraesentationis et administrationis, et cur eligi debent praelati, et qualis ordo servari, et quomodo cardinales tamquam legati provinciarum a provinciis eligi. | And there the foundation of the entire matter of representation and administration is laid open, and why prelates ought to be elected, what order should be maintained, and how cardinals, as legates of the provinces, are to be elected by the provinces. |
| R8 | Et ibi de ipsis aliqua singularia, quod ipsorum potestas ex communi consensu exorta est, et quomodo. | And there, some singular points about them, that their power arose from common consent, and how. |
| R8 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R8 | XIX. | XIX. |

| R9 | Quod papa non possit tollere, immutare vel retractare universales canones, et probatur auctoritatibus et exemplis et professionibus ac argumentis multis. | That the pope cannot revoke, change, or retract universal canons, and this is proven by authorities, examples, professions, and many arguments. |
| R9 | Et quod dispensatio et declaratio rationem canonis in particulari casu locum non habere locum habet absque canonum praeiudicio, et ibi de hoc latissime, quia ita expedit. | And that dispensation and declaration, which seem to contradict universal canons in a particular case, do not have a place without prejudice to the canons, and this is discussed at length, as it is expedient. |
| R9 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R9 | XXI. | XXI. |
| R9 | Quod etiam dispensare et aliquid disponere, quod videatur universalibus canonibus contrarium, papa sine cardinalibus non debeat. | That the pope ought not to dispense or arrange anything that appears contrary to universal canons without the cardinals. |
| R10 | Post superiora de conciliis aliis particularibus aliqua restantia annectuntur. | After the foregoing on councils, some remaining matters about other particular councils are appended. |
| R10 | Et primo: Cap. | And first: Chapter. |
| R10 | XXII. | XXII. |
| R10 | Quod provincialis synodus per metropolitanum, qui est iudex provinciae, licet criminales causas per se iudicare nequeat, congregari debeat, et quod concilia sunt optime et necessarie pro bono ecclesiae instituta. | That a provincial synod ought to be convened by the metropolitan, who is the judge of the province, even though he cannot judge criminal cases himself, and that councils are instituted for the good of the church in the best and most necessary way. |
| R10 | Et de universali concilio multarum provinciarum, quomodo est supra particularia provincialia, et quomodo iudices locorum concurrere debent in illis, et quod solvi non debeat, nisi praefinito loco futuro celebrando et tunc cunctis determinatis. | And concerning a universal council of many provinces, how it is above particular provincial councils, and how the local judges ought to convene in them, and that it should not be dissolved unless a predetermined place is set for a future celebration, with all matters then determined. |
| R10 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R10 | XXIII. | XXIII. |
| R10 | Quod forma celebrandi illud concilium tradatur in quarto capitulo Toletani concilii et inseritur de verbo ad verbum, quae est notanda per omnia, maxime in fine. | That the form of celebrating that council is handed down in the fourth chapter of the Toledo Council and is inserted verbatim, which is notable in all respects, especially at the end. |
| R10 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R10 | XXIV. | XXIV. |
| R10 | Quod universalia unius nationis vel regni magni concilia habent magnam potestatem et de omnibus etiam de fidei diffinitionibus invenitur se intromisisse. | That universal councils of one nation or a great kingdom have great power and are found to have involved themselves in matters of faith definitions as well. |
| R10 | Et iudicat de contendentibus de primatu et breviter de omnibus, quae in natione aut regno oriuntur. | And it judges disputes over primacy and briefly all matters that arise in a nation or kingdom. |
| R10 | Et ibi, quod non nisi ex universalibus et arduis causis congregari debeat, et quomodo. | And there, that such councils ought to be convened only for universal and arduous causes, and how. |
| R10 | Et etiam, qualiter per legatos provinciarum vel eorum, qui concilio intersunt, plena auctoritas concilii habetur. | And also, how full authority of the council is held through the legates of the provinces or those present at the council. |
| R10 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R10 | XXV. | XXV. |
| R10 | Quod universalia talia concilia tamquam caput congregans eis nihilominus subsit, sic etiam pariformiter papa universalis ecclesiae concilio subest, licet ad eius iussum congregetur, et quod, sicut auctoritas primorum conciliorum universalium a congregante non dependet, ita nec universalis ecclesiae concilii auctoritas a papa. | That such universal councils, gathering as a head for them, are nonetheless subject to the universal church council, just as the pope is also subject to the universal church council, even though it is convened at his command, and that, just as the authority of the first universal councils does not depend on the one convening them, so too the authority of the universal church council does not depend on the pope. |
| R10 | Et ibi pulchra de hoc, quomodo continuari ipsa concilia debeant. | And there, beautiful things are said about how these councils ought to be continued. |
| R10 | Et ibi causa utilitatis eorum. | And there, the cause of their utility. |

| R11 | Et quia omnis abusus potestatis ecclesiasticae est maxime, qui reformari debet, ideo primo de potestate ecclesiastica. | And because every abuse of ecclesiastical power especially needs to be reformed, therefore we first discuss ecclesiastical power. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXVI. | XXVI. |
| R11 | Quod potestas sacerdotio tradita est libera a Christo ei credita pro salute animarum in dei laudem ordinata, et quod ex hoc virtus distributiva sacramenti eucharistiae illimitate est eis credita, et quod fideles decipi in modo distributionis ita a libera et credita potestate sacerdotii dependentis non possint, in quo dissolvitur error Bohemorum dicentium utramque speciem de necessitate salutis distribui debere. | The power handed over to the priesthood is free, entrusted to it by Christ for the salvation of souls and ordered to the praise of God; from this, the distributive power of the sacrament of the Eucharist is entrusted to them without limit, and the faithful cannot be deceived in the manner of distribution, which depends on the free and entrusted power of the priesthood, whereby the error of the Bohemians is refuted, who say that both species must be distributed of necessity for salvation. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXVII. | XXVII. |
| R11 | Quod maior deformatio oritur ex deformatione capitis et ex hoc, quod superiores inferiorum potestatem usurpant. | The greater deformation arises from the deformation of the head and from the fact that superiors usurp the power of inferiors. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXVIII. | XXVIII. |
| R11 | Quod papae regulariter competit arduas causas diffinire et curam universalem ecclesiae habere, metropolitanos confirmare, sicut cuilibet patriarchae in suo districtu, et ibi de sententia Calcedonensi et canone octavi concilii. | It competes regularly with the pope to define difficult cases and to have universal care of the church, to confirm metropolitans, as any patriarch in his district, and there, about the Chalcedonian sentence and the canon of the eighth council. |
| R11 | Ex quibus et aliis potestas ordinaria papae elicitur, scilicet facere praemissa et synodos suas et ad eas metropolitanos convocare et inter metropolitanos iudicare. | From these and other things, the ordinary power of the pope is elicited, namely to do the aforementioned things and to hold his own synods and to summon metropolitans to them and to judge among metropolitans. |
| R11 | Et ibi, quomodo principes seu imperator solum universalis ecclesiae conciliis, non illis papalibus seu patriarchalibus, interfuisse consuevit, et quomodo, nisi ius unicuique illaesum et canones serventur, pax ecclesiae perit. | And there, how princes or the emperor are accustomed to attend only universal church councils, not papal or patriarchal ones, and how, unless the right of each is preserved and the canons are observed, the peace of the church perishes. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXIX. | XXIX. |
| R11 | Quod canones octavi concilii corrupte saepe in decreto positi ad reformationem optimi sint, et quod iuxta octavum canonem eius metropolitani saecularibus curis vacare nullo modo debeant et spiritualia per suffraganeos exercere, et quod maxima deformitas oritur ex hoc, quod praelati tantum saecularibus curis invigilant. | The canons of the eighth council, often corruptly placed in the decree, are for the reformation of what is best; and according to the eighth canon of it, metropolitans ought not in any way to be occupied with secular cares, but to exercise spiritual things through suffraganeos, and that great deformation arises from this, that prelates attend very much to secular cares. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXX. | XXX. |
| R11 | Quod magna sit deformitas in eo, quod correctio et visitatio vertitur in quaestum, et ibi canon illius octavi concilii, qui dicit illum sacrilegum, qui sub specie visitationis subiectas ecclesias gravat, et quomodo avaritiam de praesidentibus et maxime Romana curia tolli oporteat, et quod necessitati ecclesiae communi ordinata contributione subveniri debeat. | There is great deformation in that correction and visitation are turned into gain, and there the canon of that eighth council, which says that he is a sacrilegian who burdens subject churches under the guise of visitation, and how avarice ought to be removed from those presiding, especially the Roman curia, and that it is necessary for the common necessity of the church to be provided for by a common and ordered contribution. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXXI. | XXXI. |
| R11 | Quod remedium sit in octavo concilio c. | A remedy is in the eighth council, chapter 26, published, how subjects oppressed by a bishop can be relieved in the form of a judgment, and how it is necessary to come gradually to the patriarch through appeals. |
| R11 | 26 editum, quomodo gravatis subditis per episcopum in forma iudicii subveniatur, et quomodo gradatim usque ad patriarcham per apellationes deveniendum sit. | Cap. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXXII. | That monks promoted to episcopal dignity are bound to preserve monastic habit and life by canon 27; and that prelates ought to be made through elections, and that such elections ought to be celebrated very freely without pressure, and that bishops made by the precepts of princes through the power of the bishop are to be deposed, and that only the suitable are to be assumed to prelatures through ascension, which ought to be done gradually, who are tonsured only for the zeal of God, not for the appetite of ruling. |
| R11 | Quod monachi promoti ad dignitatem episcopalem habitum et vitam monasticam servare teneantur ex canone 27, et quod praelati per electiones fieri debeant, et quod tales electiones liberrime absque impressione debeant celebrari, et quod episcopi ex praeceptione principum ex potentatu episcopi facti deponendi sint, et quod solum idonei per ascensum, qui gradatim fieri debet, assumendi sint ad praelaturas, qui solum zelo dei, non appetitu principandi, tonsi sunt. | And there, that he ought to have stood four years in the priesthood previously, and that promotions ought to be made gradually from the same church, if worthy men are found, and that those who have exercised secular care ought not to be assumed, and that a bishop ought not to be given to unwilling persons, and many strong and fair reasons for this, how elections are founded in divine and human law. |
| R11 | Et ibi, quod quattuor annis in sacerdotio prius stare debuerit, et quod de eadem ecclesia, si digni inveniuntur, promotiones gradatim fieri debeant, et qui gesserunt curam saecularium assumi non debere, et quod invitis episcopus dari non debeat, et multae pulchrae rationes fortes ad hoc, quomodo electiones in iure divino et humano fundatae sunt. | Cap. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXXIII. | That reformation necessarily demands that each person satisfy his office and vow, and certain things are enumerated that are necessary to be done if ordered reformation is to be introduced into the church and priesthood. |
| R11 | Quod reformatio deposcit necessario, ut quisque officio et voto satisfaciat, et enumerantur aliqua, quae etiam sunt necessaria fieri, si reformatio ordinata introduci debet in ecclesiam et sacerdotium. | Cap. |
| R11 | Cap. | XXXIV. |
| R11 | XXXIV. | Finally, it will be briefly recapitulated whatever is set forth, and the opinion of those who deny that the primacy of Peter is from Christ is refuted, and the very truth is solidified, which says that the principality of the pope is from Christ through the consent of the church, and that his power is from God, but coercion is through the church. |
| R11 | Ultimo epilogabitur in brevi, quicquid praemittitur, et evacuatur opinio eorum, qui primatum Petri a Christo esse negant, et solidatur ipsa veritas, quae dicit principatum papae a Christo mediante consensu ecclesiae esse, et quod eius potestas est a deo, coactio vero mediante ecclesia. | Thirdly, the exceptional praises of our present, most pious Sigismund, the greatest emperor, crowned by God, ought to be set forth in a preliminary discussion. |
| R12 | Essent tertio loco pandendae praeambulari locutione eximiae laudes nostri a deo coronati praesentis piissimi Sigismundi, imperatoris maximi. | And because he himself is that other Augustus, who forbade himself to be called lord, and rightly that other most humble Basil, whose praises are manifested in subsequent things, he easily pardons, especially me, the most unlearned of all, who, while I am not able to fulfill the smallest things, easily confuse the greatest, or even immense things, in a confused style, and I would not even offer the argument of future truth, if I were to sing the praises of his invincible Caesar, living and having an effective empire in me, his servant. |
| R12 | Et quia ipse ille alter Augustus, qui se dominum nominari vetuit, ac recte alter Basilius humillimus, cuius laudes subsequentia manifestant, ignoscit faciliter, maxime mihi rudissimo omnium, qui, cum minima explere nequeam, facile in maximis, immo in immensis, confuso stilo etiam prius clara convolverem nec ad futurum etiam veritatis argumenti praeberem, si eius invictissimi Caesaris viventis et imperium efficax in me, suum servulum, habentis laudes canerem. | For the presumption of flattery and the desire to please all princes while they live diminish faith, especially if they are written down by those who are constituted in a humble condition. |
| R12 | Praesumptio enim adulationis et principibus omnibus, dum vivunt, complacendi fidem parvifaciunt, si ab hiis maxime, qua ego, humili conditione constituti, scripturis mandantur. | Therefore, coming to the thing, the whole intention is turned to this, that the power of our sacred empire, which is among the Germans, may be known, in order that the concordance by which the souls of the holy priesthood are united may be preserved, so that it may live catholically. |
| R12 | Ad rem itaque veniens versatur tota intentio, ut sciatur potentia sacri nostri imperii, quod apud Alemannos est, in finem ut conservetur et concordantia, qua se animae sacerdotii sancti unit, ut vivat catholice, sciatur. | Therefore, for the foundation of this difficult thing, it is first necessary to inquire about the sacred empire itself, in what order or dependence and by what way it subsists among the Germans. |
| R12 | Est itaque pro huius et difficilis rei fundamento primo inquirendum de ipso sacro imperio, quo ordine aut qua dependentia et qua via apud Alemannos subsistat. | Hence, it will be rightly investigated in the first place: Cap. |
| R13 | Unde primo loco recte investigabitur: Cap. | I. |
| R13 | I. | From what root all legislation and principality, especially monarchical, arises and how it is solidified, and from this, the emperor in the corporal hierarchy, as the pope in the spiritual, is the head and prince of all. |
| R13 | Qua radice legislatio ac principatus omnis et maxime monarchicus exoritur ac quomodo solidetur, et exinde imperatorem in corporali hierarchia, sicut papam in spirituali, caput et omnium principem esse. | Cap. |
| R13 | Cap. | IV. |
| R13 | II. | That imperial power, ordinately, does not depend on the pope from the gift of Constantine in the western regions, and that that famous donation is apocryphal, as are certain other things, and there certain true histories about Pippin and Charles are briefly connected, to know how temporal things first came to the Roman church. |
| R13 | Quod imperialis potestas ordinate ex dono Constantini in occiduis a papa non dependet, et quod ipsa famosa donatio apocrypha sit, sicut quaedam alia, et ibi historiae quaedam verae de Pippino et Carolo breviter connexae ad sciendum, quomodo temporalia primum ad Romanam ecclesiam devenerunt. | Cap. |
| R13 | Cap. | IV. |
| R13 | III. | That the empire was never transferred from the Greeks to the Germans or Franks through the pope, although they were called Roman patricians or even emperors, as Henry the Fourth, crowned in the general council of Basel, was called patrician, but that Otto the First was the first among all emperors created emperor with full right and in the right order by the Roman people and clergy and synod with his successors. |
| R13 | Quod imperium non fuit umquam de Graecis translatum per papam in Germanos vel Francos, licet patricii Romanorum seu etiam imperatores dicerentur, sicut Henricus quartus in generali Basiliensi concilio coronatus patricius dicebatur, sed quod Otto primus fuit inter omnes imperatores primus pleno iure recto ordine per populum et clerum Romanum et synodum cum successoribus creatus imperator. | And about this, there are histories. |
| R13 | Et de hoc historiae. | Cap. |
| R13 | Cap. | IV. |
| R13 | IV. | That electors are not created by the Roman pontiff nor do they have power, but from the common consent of those subject to the empire, who by divine and human law, not positive law, can appoint an emperor for themselves, and that a right and just empire has its power solely from their election without papal confirmation, and that they cannot be deposed by the pope alone. |
| R13 | Quod electores a Romano pontifice non sunt nec creati nec potestatem habent, sed ex communi consensu subiectorum imperio, qui divino et humano iure, non positivo, sibi imperatorem praeficere possunt, et quod rectum et iustum imperium vim solam ex eorum electione absque papali confirmatione habet, et quod deponi a solo papa non possint. | After these things, the power of the empire will be investigated. |
| R14 | Post haec investigabitur potestas imperii. | And first: Cap. |
| R14 | Et primo: Cap. | V. |
| R14 | V. | The empire has supreme power in the world and vicarial substitution from Christ; hence, it is said to be the minister of God and the vicar of Christ, bearing the type of Christ reigning over all nations. |
| R14 | Imperium potestatem supremam mundi ac vicariam substitutionem a Christo habere; hinc et dei minister et Christi vicarius dicitur gerens typum Christi regnantis super omnes gentes. | Cap. |
| R14 | Cap. | VII. |
| R14 | VI. | That the power of the empire is equal to obediential subjection, and that the Roman empire never was in certain provinces and kingdoms there named, although the lord of the world is said to be from the greater part, and it justly possesses the supreme place among all potentates from its approximation to Christ reigning through faith. |
| R14 | Quod imperii potestas aequatur subiectioni oboedientiali, et quod Romanum imperium in certis ibi nominatis provinciis et regnis numquam fuit, licet dominus mundi a maiore parte dicatur et inter cunctos potentatus supremum locum ex approximatione ad Christum regnantem per fidem iuste possideat. | Cap. |
| R14 | Cap. | VII. |
| R14 | VII. | That the supreme care committed to the emperor, for which he excels all, is in the custody of orthodox faith, and that in his way he is equal to the pope, since the helm of faith is also committed to him as to custody, as to the priesthood as to inquiry and teaching, and that he obtains this highest power from the election of Christians. |
| R14 | Quod imperatori suprema commissa cura, ob quam omnibus praeeminet, est in custodia orthodoxae fidei, et quod suo modo papae aequetur, cum sibi etiam fidei gubernacula commissa sint quoad custodiam, sicut a sacerdotio quoad inquisitionem et magisterium, et quod hanc summam potestatem ab electione Christianorum consequitur. | That the supreme care entrusted to the emperor, by which he surpasses all others, is in the guardianship of the orthodox faith, and that in his own way he is equal to the pope, since the governance of the faith has also been entrusted to him as regards its guardianship, just as to the priesthood as regards investigation and teaching, and that he derives this supreme power from the election of Christians. |
| R15 | Deinde examinatur, an in conciliis episcoporum imperator, cum laicus sit, interesse debeat, occasione cuius primo dicitur: Cap. | Then it is examined whether the emperor, being a layman, ought to attend episcopal councils, concerning which it is said first: Chapter. |
| R15 | VIII. | VIII. |
| R15 | Quod laici certis conciliis interesse debent ad se defendendum, aliis ad tantum audiendum, et quod principes in sibi subiecta patria pro corrigendis delictis et reformatione concilia congregare debent. | That laymen ought to attend certain councils for their own defense, others for the sake of hearing, and that princes ought to convene councils in the lands subject to them for correcting offenses and reformation. |
| R15 | Et ibi exemplum de Carolo Magno. | And there an example of Charlemagne. |
| R15 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R15 | IX. | IX. |
| R15 | Quod sanctus Gregorius Theodericum, regem Francorum, exhortatus est et monuit, ut concilium congregaret episcoporum et de suo regno concubinatum et symoniam eliminaret. | That Saint Gregory exhorted and admonished Theodoric, king of the Franks, to convene a council of bishops and to eliminate concubinage and simony from his kingdom. |
| R15 | Et ibi alia exempla de Recaredo, rege Hispaniae et Galliae, et quod regum sit illa exsequi, quae in illis conciliis communi consensu dictantur. | And there other examples of Recared, king of Spain and Gaul, and that it is the duty of kings to carry out those things which are decreed in those councils by common consent. |

| R15 | Quod reges et principes cum magna reverentia et devotione illis conciliis interfuere cum dulcissimis exhortationibus. | That kings and princes attended those councils with great reverence and devotion, with the sweetest exhortations. |
| R15 | Et ibi notandum exemplum Recaredi regis. | And there is a noteworthy example of King Recared. |
| R15 | Ad idem Sisenandi et Chincillai regum exempla. | To the same, examples of the kings Sisenand and Chinchila. |
| R15 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R15 | XI. | XI. |
| R15 | Quod rex obligetur ad augmentum fidei et devotionis in subiectis, et tunc tenetur forma virtutis exemplo doctrinae sancti Gregorii ad Hilpertum, regem Francorum, et quod ecclesia ipsis credita est, de qua commissione rationem reddere tenentur. | That the king is obligated to increase faith and devotion in his subjects, and then he is bound by the example of virtue, by the teaching of Saint Gregory to Hilpert, king of the Franks, and that the Church has been entrusted to them, for which commission they are bound to give an account. |
| R15 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R15 | XII. | XII. |
| R15 | Quod rex aut princeps leges et statuta generalia provinciam respicientia in generalibus utriusque status sui regni conciliis per consensum edere habet et illa salva epikeia exsequi et defensare, et quod cotidianum concilium de electis ex tota provincia subiecta de consensu universalis sui concilii habere debeat. | That a king or prince has the right to issue general laws and statutes concerning the province in the general councils of both estates of his kingdom by common consent, and to carry out and defend them with due consideration for equity, and that he should have a daily council of chosen men from the entire subject province by the consent of his universal council. |
| R16 | Consequenter subiungitur, quomodo imperator quoad ipsa universalia totius ecclesiae concilia se habere debeat. | Subsequently, it is added how the emperor should conduct himself with regard to the universal councils of the whole Church. |
| R16 | Et primo: Cap. | And first: Chapter. |
| R16 | XIII. | XIII. |
| R16 | Quod imperator ad universalem synodum totius catholicae ecclesiae quoad collectionem et exhortationem et cetera se habet sicut rex in suo regno, et ibi quomodo et quando congregare solitus est imperator universalia illa concilia. | That the emperor, with respect to the universal synod of the whole Catholic Church, stands in the same relation as a king in his kingdom, and there how and when the emperor was accustomed to convene those universal councils. |
| R16 | Et ibi exempla aliquorum imperatorum nota digna inserta ad longum ex causa, ut obstruantur ora modernorum, qui pauca vetera viderunt. | And there are inserted examples of some emperors worthy of note, at length, for the purpose of silencing the modern men who have seen few ancient things. |
| R16 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R16 | XIV. | XIV. |
| R16 | Quod imperator operam dare debet, ut omnis tumultus vitetur in conciliis, et expulsis expellendis in tranquillitate et libertate concilium constituatur cum punitione turbantium patres. | That the emperor should strive to prevent all tumult in councils, and that, with the disruptive elements expelled, the council should be constituted in tranquility and freedom, with punishment for those who disturb the fathers. |
| R16 | Et ibi de hoc exempla pulchra. | And there are beautiful examples of this. |
| R16 | Cap. | Chapter. |
| R16 | XV. | XV. |
| R16 | Quod imperialis convocatio ad synodos est exhortatoria et papalis quoad sacerdotium praeceptoria, et quod imperialis urgente necessitate ecclesiae papa negligente praeceptoria fiat. | That the imperial summons to synods is exhortatory, and the papal, with regard to the priesthood, is preceptive, and that the imperial summons becomes preceptive when the Church is in urgent need, the pope being negligent. |

| R20 | DE CONCORDANTIA CATHOLICA LIBER PRIMUS | ON CATHOLIC CONCORDANCE, BOOK ONE |
| 4 | Capitulum I. | Chapter I. |
| 4 | Quia facile scienti fundamenta patescere possunt elicienda, quantum minimo ingenio ex alto dabitur, de illa profunda divina ecclesiae harmonia perpauca dicam. | Since the foundations may easily be laid open to one who knows, as much as will be granted from on high to the least intellect, I will say very little about that profound divine harmony of the Church. |
| 4 | Concordantia enim est id, ratione cuius ecclesia catholica in uno et in pluribus concordat, in uno domino et pluribus subditis. | For concordance is that by reason of which the Catholic Church agrees in one and in many, in one Lord and many subjects. |
| 4 | Et ab uno infinitae concordantiae rege pacifico fluit illa dulcis concordantialis harmonia spiritualis gradatim et seriatim in cuncta membra subiecta et unita, ut sit unus deus omnia in omnibus. | And from one infinite King of peaceful concordance flows that sweet spiritual harmony of concordance gradually and in order into all subjected and united members, so that there may be one God all in all. |
| 4 | Sumus enim ab initio ad hanc supermirandam harmonicam pacem in adoptionem filiorum dei per Iesum Christum praedestinati, qui ideo descendit, ut adimpleret omnia. | For from the beginning, we have been predestined through Jesus Christ to this most wondrous harmonious peace in the adoption of the sons of God, who therefore descended to fulfill all things. |
| 5 | Hanc praedestinationem probat apostolus ad Ephesios per id, quod a principio pronuntiatum est, quia reliquit homo patrem et matrem et adhaerebit uxori suae, et erunt ambo in carne una. | The Apostle proves this predestination to the Ephesians by that which was proclaimed from the beginning: “A man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.” |
| 5 | Sacramentum est Christi et ecclesiae. | This is a sacrament of Christ and the Church. |
| 5 | Si ergo Adae et Evae copula sacramentum magnum est in Christo et ecclesia, certum est, quod, sicut Eva os de ossibus viri fuit et caro de carne eius, tunc et ecclesia de membris Christi est os de ossibus et caro de carne eius. | If, therefore, the union of Adam and Eve is a great sacrament in Christ and the Church, it is certain that, just as Eve was bone of the bones and flesh of the flesh of the man, so too the Church is bone of the bones and flesh of the flesh of Christ. |
| 5 | Unde Ambrosius in epistula 16 ad Herennium hanc epistulam Pauli extollens ait: «Nulla benedictionis tantae epistula increpuit in plebem dei sicut illa». | Whence Ambrose, extolling this Pauline epistle in Epistle 16 to Herennius, says: “No epistle of such great blessing has rebuked the people of God like that one.” |
| 5 | Et dicit, quod Christus sedet ad dexteram patris, et nos omnes «non sedebimus, sed consedebimus in Christo et eius carne in caelestibus. | And he says that Christ sits at the right hand of the Father, and we all “will not sit, but will sit together in Christ and His flesh in the heavens.” |
| 5 | » Ut autem ad illam aeternam concordantissimam unionem perveniremus per fidem, posuit gradualem differentem concordantiam ecclesiasticam «alios dando apostolos, alios episcopos, alios doctores etc. | But so that we might attain to that eternal most harmonious union through faith, He established a gradual and differing ecclesiastical concordance, “giving some as apostles, some as bishops, some as teachers, etc.,” so that each “in the unity of faith and knowledge may meet the head,” and as a member may not be lacking to his head, Christ, who is the head of all, from whom the body of the faithful, fitted together and compacted through the reasonable harmony of the Word, and connected through every joint of ministry in the measure of each part, makes the growth of the body for its edification in love, so that one temple may arise in all and one dwelling place of habitation in the spirit of all. |
| 5 | ,» ut quisque «in unitate fidei et agnitionis occurrat capiti et ut quasi membrum non desit capiti suo Christo, qui est caput omnium, ex quo &laddunum&radd corpus fidelium per harmoniam rationabilem verbi compaginatum atque compactum atque connexum per omnem iuncturam ministrationis in mensuram uniuscuiusque partis augmentum in corporis facit aedificationem sui in caritate, ut assurgat unum templum in omnibus et unum domicilii habitaculum in spiritu universorum. | In this, I judge that not only the connection of holy men but of all believers, even of all superior rational virtues and powers, is to be received in the faith and spirit, so that through a certain harmony of virtues and ministries, one body from all rational spirits of nature may adhere to its head, Christ, so connected by the bond of edification that not even the touch of the joint of individuals adhering may seem to differ. |
| 5 | In quo non solum sanctorum hominum, sed omnium credentium, omnium etiam superiorum rationabilium virtutum atque potestatum connexionem fidei spiritusque accipiendam arbitror, ut per harmoniam quandam virtutum ac ministeriorum corpus unum ex omnibus rationabilis naturae spiritibus adhaereat capiti suo Christo ita aedificationis compage conexa, ut ne tactu quidem iunctura singulorum adhaerentium discrepare videatur. | These and many beautiful things Ambrose [says] in the aforementioned place. |
| 5 | » Haec et plura pulchra Ambrosius ubi supra. | And Jerome agrees in the penultimate question of the Epistle to Algasia and in the Epistle on Monogamy, where he says: “Eve signifies the Church, because the mother of the living; Adam, Christ; marriage, the unity of the spirit. |
| 5 | Et concordat Hieronymus in epistula ad Algasiam quaestione paenultima et in epistula De monogamia, &laddubi&radd dicit: «Eva ecclesiam significat, quia mater viventium, Adam Christum, matrimonium unitatem spiritus. | Christ is the head of the woman, and the woman, that is, the Church, formed from the rib of the man and flesh of the flesh.” |
| 5 | Christus caput mulieris, et mulier, id est ecclesia, de costa viri formata et caro de carne. | So says he. |
| 5 | » Haec ille. | There are many writings of the saints on this matter, which I deem to be omitted for brevity. |
| 5 | Multa sanctorum scripta, quae brevitatis causa praetermittenda censeo, de hoc sunt. | And since it is most manifest that all being and living are constituted through concordance, then in that divine essence, where life and being are one in the highest equality, there is the highest and infinite concordance, since no contrariety can have place there where eternity is life. |
| 6 | Et quia manifestissimum est omne esse et vivere per concordantiam constitui, tunc in illa divina essentia, ubi vita et esse unum sunt summa aequalitate, est summa et infinita concordantia, quoniam ibi nulla contrarietas locum habere potest, ubi aeternitas vita est. | All concordance, however, is of differences. |
| 6 | Omnis autem concordantia differentiarum est. | And the lesser the contrariety in differences, the stronger and longer-lasting the concordance, and there it is eternal where there is no contrariety. |
| 6 | Et quanto minor contrarietas in differentiis, tanto fortior concordantia et longior vita, et ibi aeterna tunc est, ubi nulla contrarietas. | From this root, behold the lofty foundations of the most holy Trinity and Unity, since the Unity is in the Trinity and the Trinity in the Unity, and no contrariety at all, because as the Father is, so is the Son, so also the Holy Spirit. |
| 6 | Ex hac enim radice vide alta fundamenta sanctissimae trinitatis et unitatis, quoniam unitas in trinitate et trinitas in unitate, nec ulla penitus contrarietas, quia qualis pater, talis filius, talis et spiritus sanctus. | Behold the inexpressible concordance in the Triune and One God, from which indeed, for one wishing to investigate more subtly how all things most perfect sayable or thinkable about God are in the highest concordance of one essence and three persons, the greatest and incomprehensible truth, which is presented to the eyes of the intellect through this discourse, may be deduced. |
| 6 | Ecce inexpressibilem concordantiam in deo trino et uno, a qua quidem concordantia volenti subtilius indagare, quomodo cuncta perfectionalia de deo dicibilia aut cogitabilia in summa concordantia unius essentiae et trium personarum sunt, maxima et incomprehensibilis veritas, quae ex hoc discursu oculis intellectus obicitur, elici potest. | Behold the inexpressible concord in the triune God, from which concordance, if one wishes to investigate more subtly how all the perfections that can be said or thought of God are in the supreme concord of one essence and three persons, a most great and incomprehensible truth, which is presented to the eyes of the intellect from this discourse, can be elicited. |
| 7 | Quoniam haec concordantia est ipsamet veritas summa, – sed non est nostri propositi – sufficit cum Alberto Magno super verbo: Tu es Christus, filius Dei vivi, Matth. | Since this harmony is the very highest truth, but not the purpose of our proposal, it suffices with Albert the Great on the word: "You are Christ, the Son of the living God," Matthew 16, to know for our purpose that "the Father is the fountain of life, which receives its vein in the Son and its flow in all things in the Holy Spirit." |
| 7 | 16 scire ad nostrum propositum, quod «Pater est fons vitae, quae in Filio venam accipit et fluxum in omnes in Spiritu sancto», quoniam per unitatem spiritus matrimonium, quod inter Christum et ecclesiam est, constituitur, sicut placet Cypriano in De unitate ecclesiae: «Qui deum patrem habere vult, non potest in vitam regenerari nisi per matrem viventium, scilicet ecclesiam», et tunc, cum in unitate spiritus est cum Christo, Christi membrum est, a quo per adhaesionem et concordantiam secundum gradus transformamur, ut ait Augustinus ad Consentium De trinitate: «Deus, cum in se ipso sit vita, nobis vita efficitur, cum eius utcumque efficimur participes, et cum in se ipso sit iustitia, etiam nobis fit iustitia, cum ei cohaerendo iuste vivimus, et tanto magis minusve iusti sumus, quanto magis minusve illi cohaeremus. | **For through the unity of the spirit, the marriage which is between Christ and the Church is constituted, as it pleases Cyprian in De unitate ecclesiae**: "He who wishes to have God as Father cannot be regenerated into life except through the mother of the living, namely the Church," and then, when one is in unity of spirit with Christ, one is a member of Christ, from whom we are transformed through adherence and harmony according to degrees, as Augustine says to Consentius De trinitate: "God, since He is life in Himself, becomes life for us when we are made participants in Him in some way, and since He is justice in Himself, He also becomes justice for us when we live justly by Him." |
| 7 | Unde scriptum est de unigenito filio dei, cum utique sit patris sapientia atque iustitia et semper in seipso sit, quod factus sit pro nobis a deo sapientia atque iustitia et sanctificatio et redemptio, ut quemadmodum scriptum est: Qui gloriatur, in domino glorietur. | Whence it is written of the only-begotten Son of God, since He is indeed the wisdom and justice of the Father and always in Himself, that He was made for us by God as wisdom and justice and sanctification and redemption, as it is written: "He who glories, let him glory in the Lord." |
| 7 | » Haec ille. | These are his words. |
| 8 | Unde haec est summa dicendorum, quod Christus est via, veritas et vita et omnium creaturarum caput, maritus sive sponsus ecclesiae, &laddquae&radd per concordantiam creaturarum omnium rationabilium ad eum unum et inter se plurium constituitur secundum varias graduationes. | Whence this is the sum of what is to be said, that Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and the head of all creatures, the husband or bridegroom of the Church, which is constituted through the harmony of all rational creatures with Him and among themselves according to various degrees. |
| 9 | Capitulum II. | Chapter II. |
| 9 | Nunc, ut propius accedamus posito hoc fundamento, scilicet, quod ecclesia per unionem ad Christum constituatur, modum intelligendi investigemus. | Now, that we may approach more closely, having laid this foundation, namely, that the Church is constituted through union with Christ, let us investigate the manner of understanding. |
| 9 | Et profecto, sicut a deo unico, aeterno, simplicissimo fluunt per creationem cuncta in quadam diversa et varie distanti imagine, ita, ut altissima prima creata participent in alto signaculo cum primo in quadam concordantia multum theophanica, licet in infinitum distanti a prima concordantia essentiali infinita, qua filius imago et splendor patris, lucis aeternae, et tres personae unus deus, propter incapacitatem creaturae, quae, cum finita sit, incapax est ex parte sua infinitae concordantiae. | And indeed, just as all things flow from the one, eternal, and simplest God through creation in a certain diverse and varied image, so the highest created things participate in the highest sign with the first in a certain concordance, much theophanic, although infinitely distant from the first essential concordance, infinite, by which the Son is the image and splendor of the Father, the eternal light, and the three persons are one God, due to the incapacity of the creature, which, since it is finite, is incapable of infinite concordance on its own part. |
| 9 | Est tamen altissima suo modo ex suprema adhaesione et sui dispositione, quae, quanto plus praecellit alia creata, tanto plus increato simplici infinito similior. | Nevertheless, the highest is in its own way from the supreme adherence and disposition, which, the more it excels other created things, the more it is similar to the uncreated, simple, and infinite. |
| 9 | Unde suo modo naturali fluxu gradatim minus similitudinis gerunt et quasi in umbra, figura seu similitudine praecedentis altioris naturae disponitur inferior gradatim, quousque multiplicatio versus inferius et ignobilius ita in radio deficiat vitalis naturae, quod absque multiplicatione amplius quiescat in ultimo puncto, ita parum habens virtutis, quod tantum sibi sufficit et non amplius communicare potest, et sic ultimum illius ordinis in umbra terminatur. | Whence in its own natural flux, it gradually bears less similitude and is disposed in a kind of shadow, figure, or similitude of the preceding higher nature, gradually, until the multiplication towards the lower and more ignoble fails in the vital nature, so that, without further multiplication, it rests in the ultimate point, having so little virtue that it suffices only for itself and cannot communicate further, and thus the ultimate of that order is terminated in shadow. |
| 9 | Et haec est graduatio ab infinito usque ad nihil, licet talis media graduatio a primo ordinata sit, nihil tamen esse potest per totam ipsam hierarchicam lineam, quod absque fontali principio a mediis constitui possit. | And this is the gradation from the infinite to nothing, although such a middle gradation is ordered from the first, nothing can be without the fontal principle throughout the entire hierarchical line. |
| 10 | Et ut mea intentio clarior fiat, utar exemplo Ambrosii in epistula ad Sabinum, qui volens lapsum humanae naturae per medias propagationes declarare, sumit exemplum magnetis lapidis, qui cum vim habeat ferrum attrahendi tantam, ut se transfundat in illius speciem, ita ut plerisque experiri volentibus, cum plures annulos ferreos ad eum lapidem admoverint, omnes pari teneat modo. | And that my intention may become clearer, I shall use the example of Ambrose in his epistle to Sabinus, who, wishing to declare the fall of human nature through intermediate propagations, takes the example of the magnet stone, which has the power of attracting iron to such an extent that it transfuses itself into its species, so that, as many who wish to experiment may find, when many iron rings are moved towards that stone, it holds all of them in the same manner. |
| 10 | Deinde si ei annulo, cui adhaeserit lapis, alium admoveas annulum et rursus per ordinem singulis substituas, licet in omnes penetret per ordinem ex illo lapide vis naturae, tamen priores nexu vehementiore constringit, posteriores remotiore. | Then, if you move another ring towards the ring to which the stone has adhered, and again substitute each one in order, although the natural power of the stone penetrates all of them in order, it nevertheless constrains the prior ones with a stronger bond and the later ones with a more remote bond. |
| 10 | Sic verbum supernum lapidem imaginor, cuius virtus penetrat cuncta usque ad ultimum, non quod gradatim deficiat virtus infinita, sed ut finitis et terminatis creaturis insit mirabilis conexionis ordo. | Thus I imagine the supernatural word as a stone, whose virtue penetrates all things to the ultimate, not that the infinite virtue fails gradually, but that there is a marvelous order of connection in finite and terminated creatures. |
| 11 | Hoc generali ordine trinitatis figuram gestant cuncta creata, quae aut spiritualia aut corporalia aut mixta sunt. | All created things, whether spiritual, corporeal, or mixed, bear the figure of the Trinity in this general order. |
| 11 | Deinde spiritualia triplici ordine distinguuntur et quilibet ordo triplici choro, ut per omnes caelestium angelicorum spirituum choros sit unitas hierarchica et signaculum trinitatis et unitatis in trinitate et trinitatis in unitate. | Then the spiritual things are distinguished by a triple order, and each order by a triple choir, so that there may be a unitary hierarchy and sign of the Trinity and unity in the Trinity and Trinity in unity through all the choirs of celestial and angelic spirits. |
| 11 | Et deinde, quantae sint subdivisionum graduationes in quolibet choro a supremo usque ad infimum angelorum et deinde cuiuslibet angeli in suis constitutivis principiis, quis capere posset? | And then, what gradations of subdivisions there are in each choir from the supreme to the infimum of angels, and then in each angel in its constitutive principles, who could comprehend? |
| 11 | Deinde suo modo in corporali natura hanc hierarchiam quaerenti inveniet triplicem ordinem et cuiuslibet tres choros. | Then, in its own way, one seeking this hierarchy in the corporeal nature will find a triple order and three choirs in each. |
| 11 | Et sicut suprema sphaera est ut umbra ultimi angeli, ita huius hierarchiae, cuius primum mobile sive nona sphaera principium est, terra ultima umbra et faex elementorum. | And just as the supreme sphere is like the shadow of the ultimate angel, so the earth is the ultimate shadow and dregs of the elements in this hierarchy, whose first mobile or ninth sphere is the principle. |
| 11 | Deinde tertia mixta natura habet se ad instar aliarum, quoniam aut ex rationali aut sensitivo aut vegetativo, et in ea ordines et chori ut in angelica. | Then the third mixed nature has itself in the likeness of the others, since it is either rational, sensitive, or vegetative, and in it, there are orders and choirs as in the angelic. |
| 11 | Et est elementativa umbra huius. | And the elementative is the shadow of this. |
| 11 | De hoc alibi. | About this elsewhere. |
| 12 | Magna enim ista sunt, in quibus a priori investigatio omnium naturalium ac universae creaturae latet. | For these are great things, in which the investigation of all natural things and the whole of creation lies hidden from the beginning. |
| 12 | Dum enim istae admirandae differentes concordantiae totius universi investigantur, quanta ibi miranda naturarum combinatio, quanta orbicularis et influentialis mutua participatio quantusve in hiis ad unum finem ordo invenitur, sapientes cognoscunt. | For while these admirable and different concordances of the whole universe are being investigated, how great a combination of natures, how great an orbicular and influential mutual participation, and what order is found in these towards one end, wise men recognize. |
| 12 | Sufficiat pro praesenti scire pro nostra investigatione, quod, licet omnia creata in esse ex principiis creatis quandam gradualem similitudinem cum primo gradatim habentibus constituantur et per concordantiam uniantur naturali et originali principio, ut conserventur, tamen nostra ecclesia, de qua sermo est, ex rationabilibus spiritibus et hominibus, qui cum Christo uniuntur, licet non omnes pariformiter, sed gradatim, ut in exemplo magnetis apertum est, tantum constituitur. | Let it suffice for the present to know for our investigation that, although all created things in being constitute a certain gradual similitude with the first, having been created from created principles, and are united through natural and original concordance with the principle, so that they may be preserved, our Church, of which we speak, is constituted from rational spirits and men who are united with Christ, although not all in the same form, but gradually, as has been made clear in the example of the magnet. |
| 13 | Capitulum III. | Chapter III. |
| 13 | Iam superius manifestatum est per Ambrosium, quomodo sancta ecclesia, quam beatus Paulus supernam Hierusalem ac matrem nostram ac manentem civitatem et aedificationem ex deo et domum non manu factam appellat, ex angelis et hominibus constet. | It has already been manifested above through Ambrose, how the holy Church, which the blessed Paul calls the supernatural Jerusalem and our mother and the abiding city and the edification from God and the house not made by hand, consists of angels and men. |
| 13 | Quae partim ex hominibus societate angelica in ordinibus distinctis perfruens iam cum deo in caelo regnat, partim vero in ordinibus distinctis peregrinatur in terra et ad societatem supernam suspirat, ubi est tabernaculum non manufactum neque huius creationis, ad cuius instar per Moysem factum est tabernaculum iuxta iussionem domini, ut omnia faceret iuxta quod in monte sibi ostendisset. | Which, in part, from men, enjoying angelic society in distinct orders, already reigns with God in heaven, and, in part, indeed, wanders in distinct orders on earth and sighs for the supernatural society, where there is a tabernacle not manufactured nor of this creation, according to whose likeness the tabernacle was made by Moses, according to the command of the Lord, so that he might make all things according to what was shown to him on the mountain. |
| 13 | In quo superno et vero tabernaculo, quod fixit deus et non homo, in interiora velaminis, id est in ipsum caelum, confessionis nostrae antistes summus et sempiternus pontifex, sempiternum habens sacerdotium sacerdosque magnus secundum ordinem Melchisedech, per proprium sanguinem introivit semel in sancta aeterna redemptione inventa sedensque ad dexteram Patris in gloria paternae maiestatis interpellat non voce, sed miseratione pro nobis. | In which supernal and true tabernacle, which God has fixed and not man, in the innermost veil, that is, in heaven itself, the high priest and eternal pontiff of our confession, having an eternal priesthood and being a great priest according to the order of Melchisedech, entered once through His own blood in the eternal redemption that has been found, and, sitting at the right hand of the Father in the glory of the paternal majesty, intercedes for us, not with voice, but with mercy. |
| 13 | Ideoque rex regum et dominus dominantium, per quem reges regnant et conditores legum iusta decernunt, caelestem et terrenum principatum, cunctam videlicet rem publicam regens tam caelestem quam spiritualem ac temporalem et terrenam, distinctis in ordinibus disponens ac moderans ac supernae atque mundanae curiae praesidens miro ordine angelorum hominumque ministeria pro temporum varietate et opportunitate dispensat et, quae singulis temporibus congruunt, vel occulta inspiratione vel evidentiori illustratione et praeceptione decernit. | And therefore, the King of kings and Lord of lords, through whom kings reign and the founders of laws decree what is just, governing the celestial and terrestrial principality, that is, the whole commonwealth, both celestial and spiritual and temporal and terrestrial, disposing and moderating in distinct orders, and presiding over the supernal and mundane court with a wondrous order, dispenses the ministries of angels and men according to the variety and opportunity of times, and decrees what is congruent with each time, either through occult inspiration or more evident illustration and precept. |
| 14 | Haec probant sancti doctores in variis passibus, quoniam per hoc, quod anima cibo sapientiae pascitur, tunc divinae efficitur consors naturae. | These things are proven by holy doctors in various steps, because through this, in which the soul is nourished by the food of wisdom, it then becomes a partner in the divine nature. |
| 14 | Filius enim est Patris sapientia. | For the Son is the Father's wisdom. |
| 14 | Et hoc deus aperuit, ut scribit Ambrosius epistula 12 ad Herennium, per prophetas et apostolos et scripturas thesauri sui, istud, scilicet fidem, quae est in Christo, ut hic per fidem cognoscamus et ibi facie ad faciem videamus. | And God revealed this, as Ambrose writes in letter 12 to Herennius, through prophets, apostles, and the scriptures of his treasure, namely faith, which is in Christ, so that we may know it through faith and see it face to face there. |
| 14 | De quo plura ibi. | About which more is said there. |
| 14 | Et idem Augustinus ad Deogratias in secunda quaestione de diversitate sacrificiorum, ubi latissime tantam difficultatem aperiens dicit unum Christum ita diversis sacrificiis tempori et loco congruis exprimi, sicut in varietate linguarum idem pronuntiatur. | And Augustine says the same in the second question to Deogratias, where he widely opens up such a great difficulty, saying that one Christ is expressed in various sacrifices, both in time and place, just as the same thing is pronounced in the variety of languages. |
| 14 | Et haec varietas pro hominum salute a deo facta et praecepta exstitit, qui numquam iustitiae pietatique mortalium deficit. | And this variety was made and given as a precept for human salvation by God, who never fails in justice and piety. |
| 14 | Aliis enim tunc moribus et signis, aliis nunc, et prius occultius et postea manifestius, et prius a paucioribus, postea a pluribus una et eadem religio sanctificatur et observatur. | For to some, then, and to others now, and previously in a more hidden and later in a more manifest way, and previously by fewer people, and later by more, one and the same religion is sanctified and observed. |
| 14 | Unde, ut idem in tertia quaestione ad eundem subiungit, graduatio in hiis sacrificiis fuit, quoniam prima ut umbrae, deinde alia ut figurae usque in Christum, qui fuit veritas. | From which, as he also adds in the third question to the same, there was a gradation in these sacrifices, because the first were like shadows, and the others like figures, up to Christ, who was the truth. |
| 14 | Et forte, ut in praecedenti capitulo tactum est, quoniam omnia creata propter Christum et ad eum sunt et unus mundus uni deo, verbo incarnato, sufficit, tunc a primordio tam in sacrificiis quam hominibus gradatim adventus clariori lumine prophetiarum manifestatus est. | And perhaps, as was touched on in the preceding chapter, because all things were created for Christ and through him, and the world is one for one God, the incarnate Word, then from the beginning, both in sacrifices and in people, the advent of Christ was gradually revealed in a brighter light of prophecies. |
| 14 | Ioannes inter natos mulierum eum digito ostendens sanctissimus ante eum, et post eum apostoli relicti. | John, the most holy, pointing him out with his finger among the born of women, and the apostles left behind him. |
| 14 | Et sicut graduatio a Christo, vero deo et homine, ad principium mundi usque in primum hominem, ita et ab eo graduatio usque in ultimum. | And just as there was a gradation from Christ, the true God and man, to the beginning of the world, up to the first man, so also from him there was a gradation up to the last. |
| 14 | Quod Augustinus ad Esitium De die novissimo declarat dicens: «Licet numquam defecerunt mali, tamen, quanto plures erunt mali, tanto plus appropinquatur ad finem. | Which Augustine declares in his letter to Esitius on the last day, saying: "Although evil never ceased, yet, the more there are of evil, the closer it approaches to the end. |
| 14 | Videmus autem malos nunc abundare apud nos, et post hoc abundantiores, et omnino abundantissimi, quando iam iamque finis instabit, qui, quamdiu aberit, ignoratur. | We see that now there are many evils among us, and afterwards even more, and completely the most, when the end, which is unknown as long as it is absent, will already be at hand. |
| 14 | Scimus tamen in novissimis diebus et temporibus nos agere sicut apostoli, sed multo magis, qui fuerunt post illos ante nos, et magis nos, quam qui erunt post nos, donec ad illos veniatur, si dici potest, qui erunt novissimorum novissimi». | We know, however, that in the last days and times we act like the apostles, but much more so, who were before us, and more than those who will be after us, until we come to those who will be the last of the last." |
| 14 | Haec ille. | These things he said. |
| 15 | Et illa est summa huius veritatis, quod nihil aliud per cunctas scripturas nisi deus et verbum caro factum crucifixum propter nos ostenditur signis et sacrificiis. | And that is the sum of this truth, that nothing else is shown throughout all the scriptures except God and the Word made flesh, crucified for us, by signs and sacrifices. |
| 15 | Hoc solum Paulus scivit, et ad hoc tantum per fidem invitamur, ut per adoptionem filiorum domini in ecclesia per fidem clamemus in spiritu: Abba pater, et simus quasi dei filius, quando resurgemus omnes incorrupti et facie ad faciem videbimus illud aeternum lumen, ut hoc latius Ambrosius epistula 23 ad Herennium. | This alone Paul knew, and we are invited to this alone through faith, so that through the adoption of the sons of the Lord in the Church through faith we may cry out in the spirit: "Abba, Father," and we may be like the sons of God, when we rise again all incorrupt and see that eternal light face to face, as Ambrose writes in letter 23 to Herennius. |
| 15 | Nam ut idem ad eundem epistula 30 scribit, ita, sicut inter animalia creata homo merito postremus quasi finis naturae formatus ad iustitiam, «sic inter homines finis legis Christus ad iustitiam omni credenti. | For as he writes to the same in letter 30, just as among created animals, man was the last to be formed, as the end of nature, "so among men, Christ is the end of the law for justice to all who believe." |
| 15 | Et sic nos ut iumenta sumus contemplatione domini, sicut ait propheta: Tamquam iumentum aestimatus sum apud te». | And thus we are like beasts in contemplating the Lord, as the prophet says: "I was esteemed as a beast before you." |
| 15 | Haec ille. | These things he said. |
| 16 | Unde ipse pastor bonus et nos oves pascuae eius. | Wherefore the good shepherd and we are his sheep. |
| 16 | Et haec sit radix vera nostrae intentionis, quia verbum est sapientia dei patris, estque sapientia vita Proverb. | And this is the true root of our intention, because the Word is the wisdom of God the Father, and it is wisdom and life, as Proverbs says. |
| 16 | 8, tunc omnis rationalis creatura, quae in vita remansit et remanebit, necessario verbo adhaerebit, et sic peccatum, quod causa mortis fuit, tam in angelis quam hominibus, contra dei sapientiam fuit. | 8, then every rational creature, which remained and will remain in life, necessarily adheres to the Word, and thus sin, which was the cause of death, was against the wisdom of God, both in angels and in men. |
| 16 | Erexit enim se angelus contra sapientiam, qui voluit altissimo similis esse, et similiter homo, qui voluit similis diis esse scientibus bonum et malum. | For an angel raised himself against wisdom, who wanted to be like the Most High, and similarly man, who wanted to be like the gods, knowing good and evil. |
| 16 | Omnis itaque humanae naturae vita post lapsum ex adhaesione per fidem mediatoris, incarnati verbi, est. | Therefore, the life of all human nature after the fall is through adherence by faith in the mediator, the incarnate Word. |
| 17 | Unde non inepte considerari potest, quomodo paradisus a principio plantata regnum ecclesiae significet, in cuius medio arbor vitae tam caelestiali quam terrenae rationabili creaturae indefectibiliter praestitisset vitam, quia ad eius radicem indeficiens fons sancti spiritus qui ecclesiam irrigat, a principio fluxit, et arbor illa fructifera semper protulit fructum vitae pascens unitos. | Wherefore it is not unreasonably to consider how the paradise planted from the beginning signifies the kingdom of the Church, in which the tree of life, both heavenly and earthly, gives life to rational creatures indefectibly, because the indestructible fountain of the Holy Spirit, which irrigates the Church, flowed from the beginning, and that fruitful tree always produced the fruit of life, nourishing the united. |
| 17 | Sed caelestialis creatura posuit se contra hanc vitam convertens se ad arborem scientiae, dum voluit similis esse altissimo absque hoc, quod per sapientiam, quae fuit ab aeterno, participanter similis fieret altissimo, quia elevavit se ad scire, volens edere de arbore scientiae. | But the heavenly creature turned itself against this life, converting itself to the tree of knowledge, while it wanted to be like the Most High without this, that it might be made similar to the Most High through wisdom, which was from eternity, because it elevated itself to know, wanting to eat from the tree of knowledge. |
| 17 | Sic et homo sprevit credere, ut similis esset altissimo; voluit scire, antequam crederet. | Thus man also despised believing, so that he might be like the Most High; he wanted to know before believing. |
| 18 | Ecce quod sapientia, quae vita est, Proverb. | Behold, what wisdom is, which is life, as Proverbs says. |
| 18 | 4, et vita, quae Christus est, perdita fuit per illas creaturas. | 4, and the life, which is Christ, was lost through those creatures. |
| 18 | Ambrosius De fide: Dei filius sapientia dei, «quia de corde patris adveniens arcana caelestia credentibus reseravit». | Ambrose On Faith: The Son of God is the wisdom of God, "because coming from the Father's heart, he revealed the heavenly mysteries to believers." |
| 18 | Dicit «credentibus», nam ut idem ad Simplicianum scribit, solus filius noscit patrem et ille etiam, cui ille revelaverit. | He says "believers," because as he writes to Simplicianus, only the Son knows the Father, and he also reveals the heavenly mysteries to him. |
| 18 | Et nullus absque revelatione filii caelestia mysteria apprehendit. | And no one apprehends heavenly mysteries without the revelation of the Son. |
| 18 | «Quicumque enim de dei maiestate aut de caelestibus, sive apostoli sive prophetae, non nisi ex revelatione demonstrata sibi loqui ausi sunt. | "For whoever from God's majesty or from heavenly things, whether apostles or prophets, dared to speak only through a demonstrated revelation to them." |
| 18 | » Haec ille. | These things he said. |
| 18 | Quomodo Christus sit sapientia, iustitia, sanctitas, fortitudo etc. | How Christ is wisdom, justice, holiness, strength, etc. |
| 18 | secundum sanctum Hieronymum 11 q. | according to St. Jerome 11 q. |
| 18 | 3 Existimant. | 3 They think. |
| 18 | Unde patet, quantus fuit error priorum spirituum et hominum, qui sine illa via ad vitam et veritatem nitebantur ascendere. | From which it is clear how great was the error of the previous spirits and men, who tried to ascend to life and truth without that way. |
| 18 | Ex quo concluditur, quod ecclesia catholica per fidem unionis ad Christum constituitur. | From which it is concluded that the Catholic Church is established through faith in union with Christ. |
| 18 | Quoniam sine fide impossibile est illam desideratam aeternam gloriam apprehendere, deum videre et dominum Iesum salvatorem. | Because without faith it is impossible to grasp the desired eternal glory, to see God, and the Lord Jesus Savior. |
| 19 | Capitulum IV. | Chapter IV. |
| 19 | Brevius loqui exigit compendium, quam exorditus sum. | The brevity of the summary requires less speech than I began with. |
| 19 | Plane itaque descendendo ad intentum in hac ecclesia trinitatis signaculum quaerentes inveniemus iam ecclesiam triplicem ordinem habentem, scilicet triumphantem, dormientem et militantem, in quolibet etiam ordine iterum trinitatem contineri cum multis aliis graduationibus triniter in quolibet choro se habentibus. | Therefore, descending to the intention in this Church of the Trinity, we will find the Church already having a triple order, namely, the triumphant, the sleeping, and the militant, and in each order, again, the Trinity is contained with many other trinary gradations in each choir. |
| 19 | Et has hierarchias triumphantis et dormientis dimittendo ad militantem stilum vertentes considerandum puto id, quod Leo Nonus 37 c. | And leaving aside the hierarchies of the triumphant and the sleeping, turning to the militant style, I think it should be considered what Leo the Ninth writes in 37 c. against the presumptions of Michael of Constantinople, saying: "The very composition of the bodily members teaches us how the Church should be understood. |
| 19 | adversus praesumptiones Michaelis Constantinopolitani scribit dicens: «Ipsa corporeorum compositio membrorum nos doceat, qualiter ecclesia intelligi debeat. | For it is the body of Christ. |
| 19 | Ipsa est enim corpus Christi. | And the apostle says: You are the body and members of members. |
| 19 | Et apostolus dicit: Vos estis corpus et membra de membro. | And just as in one body there are many members, yet not all have the same function, so we are one body in Christ, each being a member of another. |
| 19 | Et sicut in uno corpore multa membra sunt, omnia tamen non habent eundem actum, ita multi unum corpus sumus in Christo singulariter alter alterius membra. | "And below: "If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing and the other senses be? |
| 19 | » Et infra: «Si totum corpus oculus, ubi auditus et alii sensus? | Now, however, God has disposed the members of the body, each according to its function. |
| 19 | Nunc autem disposuit deus, sicut voluit, corporis membra singula officio suo apta. | But a member, not content with its own function, but wanting to usurp that of another, disrupts the order of the whole body, as if the eye were trying to discern voices, or the hearing colors. |
| 19 | Membrum vero suo officio non contentum, sed cupiens praeripere alienum, conturbat corporis ordinem totum, velut si visus voces, auditus colores discernere temptat. | Thus, the ornaments of each are not suitable for others, but each requires its own and rejects alien ones. |
| 19 | Sic singulorum ornamenta non sunt aliis congrua, sed unumquodque requirit sua et abicit aliena. | For the foot rejects the helmet and the crown, the head rejects sandals, and such discordant concord is in them, that each one would refuse to perform the function of the other. |
| 19 | Nam pes refutat galeam et coronam, caput sandalia, et tam discors concordia est in eis, ut eorum quodlibet alii officium suum omnino deputare recuset. | And yet, they rejoice in the good of one, just as they sorrow in the evil of all, and their functions are not for themselves alone, but rather for mutual utility. |
| 19 | Et tamen de bono unius pariter exsultant, sicut de malo communiter dolent, et officia sua non sibi tantum, sed magis mutuae utilitati exhibent. | From which the apostle says securely: If one member is glorified, all the members rejoice. |
| 19 | Unde securus apostolus ait: Si glorificatur unum membrum, congaudent omnia membra». | These things he said. |
| 19 | Haec ille. | He said this. |
| 20 | Et est singulare satis istud scriptum simul cum eo, quod in principio illius capituli ad Michaelem patriarcham et Leonem archidiaconum loquendo scribit: «Simus unum corpus et unus spiritus, sicut vocati sumus in una spe vocationis». | And this writing is quite singular, together with that which he writes at the beginning of that chapter, speaking to Michael the patriarch and Leo the archdeacon: "Let us be one body and one spirit, as we have been called in one hope of our calling." |
| 20 | Ex quo patet papam cum patriarchis et omnibus Christianis unum tale corpus constituere, ubi sunt diversa membra et quodlibet suo officio contentum, ne totus ordo turbetur. | From which it is evident that the pope with the patriarchs and all Christians constitutes one such body, where there are diverse members and each is content with its own office, lest the whole order be disturbed. |
| 20 | Unde ex membrorum diversitate hierarchia comprehendi potest in ordine ad unitatem concordantiae, sine qua hierarchia non subsistit. | Therefore, from the diversity of members, a hierarchy can be understood in order to the unity of concord, without which the hierarchy does not subsist. |
| 20 | Necesse est ergo concordiam illam esse in uno et pluribus, in uno capite et pluribus membris. | Therefore, it is necessary that that concord be in one and in many, in one head and in many members. |
| 21 | Et ut de multis pauca per ordinem dicamus, in hoc corpore, quod ita Christo adhaeret in spiritu, habitat spiritus vivificans totum corpus et quodlibet eius membrum, sicut anima est tota in toto et in qualibet eius parte, ut hoc late prosequitur Augustinus ad Dardanum De dei praesentia. | And to say a few things about many in order, in this body, which thus adheres to Christ in spirit, the life-giving spirit dwells in the whole body and in each of its members, just as the soul is wholly in the whole and in each of its parts, as Augustine extensively pursues in *De Dei Praesentia* to Dardanus. |
| 21 | Et ideo corpus istud animale ex Adam contractum factum est spirituale per regenerationem in Christo. | And therefore this animal body, contracted from Adam, was made spiritual through regeneration in Christ. |
| 21 | In qua regeneratione mortuum et consepultum Christo homo novus spiritualior surrexit tamquam sponsa sine macula desponsata, ut per militiam deveniat ad victoriam, quae est per mortem, ut tunc sponsa spiritualissima incorruptibilis resurgens traducatur ad unionem perpetui matrimonii. | In which regeneration, the man who was dead and buried with Christ arose as a new, more spiritual spouse, espoused without blemish, so that through warfare he may attain to victory, which is through death, so that then the most spiritual, incorruptible spouse, rising again, may be translated to the union of perpetual marriage. |
| 22 | Et manifestum est hoc corpus ecclesiae, quod ita se habuerit, ex tantum praedestinatis constitui, quia illi ante mundi constitutionem ad illam hereditatem vocati tantum pervenient. | And it is manifest that this body of the Church, which has behaved itself thus, is constituted from the predestined alone, because those who were called to that inheritance before the constitution of the world will alone arrive there. |
| 22 | Et quia hoc iudicium est cunctis hominibus incognitum, quia nemo scit, an odio vel amore dignus sit, ideo consideratione illa, quod quisque fidelis faciens voluntatem dei unus spiritus cum eo efficitur per consensum et sic sponsalia tunc contrahit futurae consummationis matrimonii, dicimus ecclesiam ex praedestinatis et praescitis constitui. | And because this judgment is unknown to all men, because no one knows whether he is worthy of hatred or love, therefore, considering that each faithful person doing the will of God is made one spirit with Him through consent and thus contracts the espousals of the future consummation of marriage, we say that the Church is constituted from the predestined and foreknown. |
| 22 | Deus enim, ut optimus est, disposito et capaci gratiam gratum facientem distribuit. | For God, as He is most good, distributes grace to the grateful, disposed and capable. |
| 22 | Sed quod non quisque huius militantis ecclesiae ad consummationem matrimonii perveniet, homo in causa est, quia ultimam victoriam, quae est per mortem, perdet demeritis suis. | But that not everyone of this militant Church will arrive at the consummation of marriage, man is the cause, because he will lose the final victory, which is through death, through his own demerits. |
| 22 | Mortis hora indicat praedestinatum et praescitum. | The hour of death indicates the predestined and foreknown. |
| 22 | Ante hoc tempus praescitus aliquando esse potest in gratia et praedestinatus in mortali peccato. | Before this time, the foreknown can sometimes be in grace and the predestined in mortal sin. |
| 22 | Praescitus autem gratiam dei absque fide et adhaesione non posset habere. | But the foreknown could not have the grace of God without faith and adherence. |
| 22 | Quare in ecclesia tunc est, et hoc modo exsistentes in gratia praesentis iustitiae solum de ecclesia esse censentur. | Therefore, he is then in the Church, and those existing in this way in the grace of present justice are alone judged to be of the Church. |
| 23 | Est deinde consideratio alia, qua ecclesia ut sponsa fidelis consideratur oboediens secundum altiorem et nobiliorem eius partem et se quoad hoc incarcerans et refrenans, ut sponso fidelis permaneat, et hoc modo incarcerans intellectum, ut credat Christum deum et hominem salvatorem etc. | Then there is another consideration, by which the Church is considered as a faithful spouse, obedient according to its higher and nobler part and imprisoning and restraining itself in this respect, so that it may remain faithful to its spouse, and in this way imprisoning the intellect, so that it may believe Christ to be God and man, savior, etc. |
| 23 | de ecclesia esse censetur. | is judged to be of the Church. |
| 23 | Unde homo secundum Augustinum Super symbolo ad instar trinitatis imaginem gerens ex spiritu et anima et corpore constitutus exsistit. | Therefore, man, according to Augustine *Super Symbolo*, bearing the image of the Trinity, as it were, constituted from spirit, soul, and body, exists. |
| 23 | Spiritus autem est superior, nobilior et altior intellectualis personae patris figuram repraesentans et corpus personam filii et anima quasi utriusque naturam participans ab utroque procedens personam Spiritus sancti. | But the spirit is superior, nobler, and higher, representing the figure of the person of the Father, and the body the person of the Son, and the soul, as it were, participating in the nature of both, proceeding from both, the person of the Holy Spirit. |
| 24 | Et sic homo se secundum spiritum intellectivum subiciens et credens in Christum, quod ipse sit via, veritas et vita, de ecclesia dicitur, licet nondum spiritus subiecerit sibi animam nec per animam corpus. | And so man, subjecting himself according to the intellective spirit and believing in Christ, that He is the way, the truth, and the life, is said to be of the Church, although the spirit has not yet subjected the soul to itself, nor the soul the body. |
| 24 | Unde ad hoc, ut homo bene divinae trinitati configuretur ad percipiendam illam vitalem concordantiam, oportet spiritum esse perfectum, scilicet, ut per fidem, spem et caritatem se iungat spiritui divino tamquam vitae et veritati. | Therefore, in order that man may be well configured to the divine Trinity to perceive that vital concord, it is necessary that the spirit be perfect, namely, that through faith, hope, and charity it may join itself to the divine spirit as life and truth. |
| 24 | Oportet animam esse perfectam, ut spiritui oboediat, cui saepe non natura, sed consuetudine peccandi resistit, et tunc animalis homo non percipit, quae sunt spiritus dei. | It is necessary that the soul be perfect, so that it may obey the spirit, which it often resists not by nature, but by the habit of sinning, and then the animal man does not perceive the things that are of the spirit of God. |
| 24 | Et sic, quando anima oboedit spiritui et spiritus Christo, non est desperandum corpus etiam naturae restitui propriae per resurrectionem, ut totus homo spiritualis deo uniatur secundum Augustinum, ubi supra. | And so, when the soul obeys the spirit and the spirit Christ, the body is not to be despaired of being restored to its own nature through resurrection, so that the whole spiritual man may be united to God, according to Augustine, where above. |
| 25 | Unde militans ecclesia secundum illam victoriam, quae est per fidem, est similis exercitui cognoscentis Christum verum deum et hominem, regem et imperatorem, vitam et veritatem, licet non omnia membra operentur secundum hoc, ut eius imperio oboediant, licet alium regem posse esse non aestiment. | Therefore, the militant Church, according to that victory which is through faith, is similar to an army knowing Christ to be the true God and man, king and emperor, life and truth, although not all members work according to this, so that they obey His command, although they do not consider that another king can be. |
| 25 | Et quamquam fides sine operibus mortua sit, tamen non est praescisio durante fide, sed adhuc est conexio ad instar membri aridi 1 q. | And although faith without works is dead, yet there is not a prescission while faith endures, but there is still a connection like that of a withered member, 1 q. |
| 25 | 1 Sicut urgeri 23 q. | 1 As it is urged, 23 q. |
| 25 | 7 Quemadmodum. | 7 As. |
| 25 | Unde dicitur haec ecclesia immaculata sponsa secundum fidem, licet per inoboedientiam animae et corporis multorum varia nomina saepe sortiatur ad instar communitatis, quae ob multos bonos et multos malos aliquando tota bona, aliquando tota mala vocatur, ut Paulus Corinthios iam bonos, iam malos nominat. | Therefore, this Church is called the immaculate spouse according to faith, although through the disobedience of the soul and body of many it often receives various names, like a community which, because of many good and many bad, is sometimes called wholly good, sometimes wholly bad, as Paul calls the Corinthians now good, now bad. |
| 25 | Fuit huius ecclesiae Paulus membrum, dum diceret: «Mente servio legi dei, carne legi peccati. | Paul was a member of this Church, when he said: "With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin." |
| 25 | » Et quia solus Deus scrutator est cordium, ideo nullum est iudicium humanum certum de membris ecclesiae, nisi in modo renatis infantibus. | And because God alone is the searcher of hearts, therefore there is no certain human judgment of the members of the Church, except in the case of newborn infants. |
| 25 | In adultis autem fictio esse potest, ut Augustinus De correctione Donatistarum multos in ecclesia ficte dicit esse. | But in adults there can be fiction, as Augustine in *De Correctione Donatistarum* says that many are fictitiously in the Church. |
| 26 | Unde ex hoc trahitur desponsationem, qua Christus militantem ecclesiam et quodlibet membrum eius desponsavit, similem esse desponsationi, qua imperator reginam Franciae desponsaret ut reginam et dominam Franciae, ita ut ipsa laboret, ut regnum oboediat sibi et sponso offerat, alias non traducetur. | Therefore, from this it is inferred that the espousal by which Christ espoused the militant Church and each of its members is similar to the espousal by which an emperor would espouse the queen of France as queen and lady of France, so that she may labor so that the kingdom may obey her and offer itself to her spouse, otherwise she will not be translated. |
| 26 | Unde licet regina constans in fide remaneat, quia tamen aliquando rebellionem regni non castigat et ad oboedientiam reducit, cum possit, non traducitur. | Therefore, although the queen remains steadfast in faith, because she does not sometimes punish the rebellion of the kingdom and reduce it to obedience, when she can, she is not translated. |
| 26 | Non enim obligavit eam sponsus ad impossibile, licet ad difficile. | For the spouse did not obligate her to the impossible, although to the difficult. |
| 26 | Et sic quoad militantis ecclesiae generalitatem ista notanda sunt. | And so, as regards the generality of the militant Church, these things are to be noted. |
| 26 | Deinceps ad explanationem corporis supra descripti accedamus eius habitudinem ponderantes. | Next, let us proceed to the explanation of the body described above, weighing its condition. |
| 27 | Capitulum V. | Chapter V. |
| 27 | Adhuc pensandum est, quoniam ecclesia ab unitate et concordantiali congregatione dicitur, quod ipsa ex fraternitate constituitur, cui nihil proprie tantum contrariatur, sicut discissio sive schisma. | It must still be considered that since the Church is called from unity and concordant congregation, that it is constituted from brotherhood, to which nothing is so properly contrary as division or schism. |
| 27 | Nam licet fides una sit funiculus colligantiae, tamen aliquando varietas opinionum absque pertinacia stat cum unitate. | For although one faith is the bond of union, yet sometimes a variety of opinions without obstinacy stands with unity. |
| 27 | Cyprianus enim et totum concilium 70 episcoporum diversi fuerunt in fide a catholica ecclesia, tamen non abscisi, quoniam non praetulerunt opinionem unitati fraternae, quia absque pertinacia fuerunt, ut Augustino placet libro secundo contra Donatistas. | For Cyprian and the whole council of 70 bishops differed in faith from the Catholic Church, yet were not cut off, because they did not prefer opinion to fraternal unity, because they were without obstinacy, as it pleases Augustine in the second book against the Donatists. |
| 27 | Deinde iudicium fidei &laddest&radd multum difficile. | Then the judgment of faith is very difficult. |
| 27 | Ambrosius ad Constantium epistula 37: «Nervi enim sunt et quidam artus sapientiae non temere credere, maxime in causa fidei, quae raro perfecta est in hominibus. | Ambrose to Constantius, Epistle 37: "For the nerves and certain limbs of wisdom are not to believe rashly, especially in the matter of faith, which is rarely perfect in men." |
| 27 | » Quare ecclesia ista militans, quae humano iudicio subest, multos habet in corpore exercitus signo extrinseco non apparentes infideles, licet latenter scissi a concordia fidei, et non expelluntur aut dampnantur, nisi cognitis hiis occultis. | Therefore, this militant Church, which is subject to human judgment, has many in the body of the army who are not outwardly apparent infidels, although secretly separated from the concord of faith, and are not expelled or condemned, unless these hidden things are known. |
| 27 | Et sicut tales non inficiunt totum exercitum, ita, quousque cognoscantur, in aliorum salutem et tutelam quae agunt effectu non carent. | And just as such do not infect the whole army, so, until they are known, what they do for the salvation and protection of others is not without effect. |
| 27 | Cum enim homo ad impossibile non obligetur, excusatur merito in occultis; et ideo ministerium illius occulti haeretici, quod in unitate ecclesiae in salutem dispensari credit recte, licet dispensatori obsit, non sibi recte disposito in unitate ecclesiae capienti. | For since man is not obligated to the impossible, he is excused in secret things; and therefore the ministry of that secret heretic, which is believed to be rightly dispensed in the unity of the Church for salvation, although it may harm the dispenser, does not rightly harm him who is rightly disposed in the unity of the Church receiving it. |
| 27 | Haec est catholica veritas, quam cuncti fideles fatentur, quam Augustinus libro secundo contra epistulam Parmeniani ad longum prosequitur. | This is the Catholic truth, which all the faithful confess, which Augustine pursues at length in the second book against the letter of Parmenian. |
| 28 | Perfectissimus itaque deus et homo, qui est mediator dei et hominum, perfectissime et infallibili ordinatione ita ordinavit, quod, sicut Augustinus ad Paulinum epistula 42 scribit ac altissimo ingenio Ambrosio in epistula ad Iustum 56 &laddplacet&radd, tunc Christus est totum illud, quod quaeritur, et medium concordantiae ad deum, per quem solum omnia. | Therefore, the most perfect God and man, who is the mediator between God and men, has perfectly and infallibly ordained that, as Augustine writes to Paulinus in Epistle 42 and Ambrose to Justus in Epistle 56, Christ is the entirety of what is sought and the medium of concordance to God, through whom all things are. |
| 28 | Igitur non obest malus minister, quoniam sanctus spiritus per praelatum praepositum et ministrum etiam fictum operatur, qui ficte in ecclesia est, ita operatur evangelizando, consecrando, regenerando, quod salus ex hoc ministerio non minus praestabitur digne recipienti, quoniam non homo, sed Christus hominis ministerio per sanctum spiritum hoc agit. | Therefore, it does not harm the wicked minister, since the Holy Spirit works through the appointed and fictitious minister and servant, who is fictitiously present in the church, in such a way that he works by evangelizing, consecrating, regenerating, that salvation will not be less provided to the worthy recipient, since it is not a man, but Christ acting through the Holy Spirit. |
| 28 | Haec est infallibilis veritas, quam Augustinus contra Parmenianum prosequitur, et habetur 1 q. | This is the infallible truth that Augustine pursues against Parmenianus, and is found in 1 q. |
| 28 | 1 Per Ysaiam et multis aliis capitulis et 19 di. | Through Isaiah and many other chapters and 19 days. |
| 28 | Secundum. | According to. |
| 28 | Et quod officium sacerdotale vim capiat a sancto spiritu, Ambrosius libro primo De poenitentia scribit. | And what the sacerdotal office receives power from the Holy Spirit, Ambrose writes in the first book of De poenitentia. |
| 28 | Ex quo nunc apparet quoad salutem membrorum ecclesiae fictos in exercitu exsistentes effectualiter ministrare. | From which now appears that the fictitious members of the church, existing in the army, effectively minister to salvation. |
| 29 | Et sic constituitur haec militans ecclesia in veritate quoad hunc finem de bonis catholicis fidelibus et fictis. | And thus the militant church is established in truth up to this end for the good, faithful, and fictitious. |
| 29 | Et in hac ultima consideratione ecclesiae stabit studium nostrum amplius. | And in this final consideration of the church, our study will stand. |
| 29 | Et sic signaculum trinitatis in consideratione ecclesiae nota, quia aut consideratur quoad iudicium divinum, et tunc solum per caritatem deo uniti sunt de ecclesia, et hos solus deus cognoscit, aut quoad iudicium angelicum, et sic fideles omnes et solum illi, et illi angelici spiritus hoc iudicium absque extrinseca operatione cognoscunt, postquam ad fidem intellectus conversus est. | And thus the sign of the Trinity is noted in the consideration of the church, because it is either considered in the divine judgment, and then only through charity united to God are those of the church known, and God alone knows these, or in the angelic judgment, and thus all the faithful and only they, and the angelic spirits know this judgment without extrinsic operation, after the intellect has been converted to faith. |
| 29 | Quae quidem fides est ut linea spiritualis continua penetrans cunctos Christo unitos usque in caput. | Which faith is as a spiritual line penetrating all those united to Christ up to the head. |
| 29 | Igitur, cum haec chorda quacumque spirituali harmonia occulte tangitur, in augmentum gaudii caelestium omnium spirituum percipitur ab ipsis angelicis spiritibus. | Therefore, when this chord is touched by any spiritual harmony, in the augmentation of the heavenly joy of all spirits, it is perceived by the angelic spirits. |
| 29 | Aliud est iudicium humanum, in quo per spem iudicantur extrinseco humano iudicio regenerati in Christo esse, quousque ex opere aut signo extrinseco aliud constet. | Another is human judgment, in which by extrinsic human judgment those regenerated in Christ are judged, until something else is established by work or sign. |
| 29 | Sperant enim homines quemquam bonum in fide permanere et sua spe aeternae gloriae non frustrari umquam velle, nec de occultis iudicium sumere debent. | For men hope that someone good will persevere in faith and not be frustrated in their hope of eternal glory, and they should not take judgment from the unknown. |
| 29 | Unde militans ecclesia est exercitui similis, qui signatur signo crucis, antichristo, qui Christo adversatur, cuius Christi vexillum exercitus gestat, ex signo et signatura extrinseca contrarius, licet non ita intrinsece omnes sint sicut extrinsece stigmatizati. | Wherefore the militant church is similar to an army, which is marked with the sign of the cross, against the Antichrist, who opposes Christ, whose banner the army bears, from the sign and extrinsic signature, although not all are intrinsically like those extrinsically stigmatized. |
| 30 | Et in hoc exercitu Christi immortali tamquam in uno corpore concordantialis unitas fidei verae aut praesumptae graduationes differentiales requirit, de quibus amplius dicendum. | And in this army of Christ, as in one body, concordantial unity of true or presumed faith requires different gradations, of which more will be said. |
| 30 | Et oportet ea transitorie saltem tangere, quae ad rem necessaria sunt, quae forte, cum sint profunda et alta, subtilius intranti maiores fructus ministrare possent, quam nostrum propositum hoc loco requirat. | And it is necessary to touch at least those things that are necessary, which, although they are deep and high, may provide greater fruits to one entering more subtly, than our purpose requires in this place. |
| 30 | Unde, ut sit una continua concordantia unius sponsi et unius sponsae, necesse est in hoc primo considerare, quod tota ecclesia una est in trinitate, scilicet triumphans est et dormiens est et militans. | Wherefore, in order that there may be one continuous concordance of one bridegroom and one bride, it is necessary to consider first that the whole church is one in the Trinity, namely, it is triumphant and sleeping and militant. |
| 30 | Unde militans est in infimo loco ad instar sicut infimus ordo hierarchiae in triumphanti illuminatur passive absque communicatione ulteriori, quoniam ibi subsistit fluxus, et medius ordo illuminatur et illuminat, supremus vero illuminat: ita militans est, in quo subsistit influentia, est dormiens in medio constituta, et deinde suprema triumphans. | Wherefore the militant is in the lowest place, like the lowest order of hierarchy in the triumphant, is illuminated passively without further communication, because there subsists a flux, and the middle order is illuminated and illuminates, the supreme indeed illuminates: thus the militant is, in which subsists influence, is sleeping in the middle established, and then the supreme triumphant. |
| 30 | Et haec est miranda continuatio per disparia media, nam tota dormiens est sub tota triumphanti, altior dormientis immediate sub infimo triumphantis et altior militantis sub infimo dormientis. | And this is a wondrous continuation through disparate means, for the whole sleeping is under the whole triumphant, the higher sleeper immediately under the lowest triumphant, and the higher militant under the lowest sleeper. |
| 30 | Tota enim dormiens ex praedestinatis est, militans vero, quousque ad dormientem vel triumphantem pertingat, semper dubia. | For the whole sleeping is of the predestined, the militant, however, is always doubtful until it reaches the sleeper or the triumphant. |
| 30 | Transitus autem de hac militanti habet se ita, quod non omnis per dormientem triumphantem attingit, sed plures absque dormienti, qui non indigent purgari. | The passage from this militant has it that not all reach the triumphant through the sleeper, but many without the sleeper, who do not need to be purified. |
| 30 | Unde inperscrutabilis est ista harmonia dormientium, licet absque ordine non sit, cum tendat in supremam. | Wherefore this harmony of the sleeping is inextricable, although it is not without order, since it tends to the supreme. |
| 31 | Et quia Christus est omnia, ut praehabitum est, tunc ex deo, angelis et hominibus per Christum deo unitis constituta est ecclesia radicali consideratione. | And because Christ is all, as has been said, then the church, established from God, angels, and men united to God through Christ, is considered in radical consideration. |
| 31 | Quare dormiens ecclesia tamquam media inter angelos et homines considerata est ut umbra angelicae et militans ut umbra dormientis, licet dormiens ab humana viatrici ecclesia non separetur, quousque traducatur in triumphantem. | Wherefore the sleeping church is considered as an angelic shadow and the militant as a shadow of the sleeper, although the sleeper is not separated from the human church by the road, until it is translated into the triumphant. |
| 31 | Unde quoad hoc considerari debet dormiens in conexitate esse cum militanti, quia in purgatione hincinde beatificandae animae exsulantur, licet illae quoad meritum dormient, istae autem adhuc militent. | Wherefore it is to be considered that the sleeper is connected with the militant, because souls are purified and glorified from here, although they are sleeping in merit, these, however, are still militant. |
| 31 | Sunt tamen in linea peregrinantium dormientes primi, quia absorpta est mors in victoria, et certi sunt de praemio et eapropter spiritualiores firmiori spe et indubitabili facti secundum gradus meriti, militantes infra in dubio et corporibus grossis quasi umbris praecedentes. | There are, however, in the line of pilgrims, the first sleepers, because death has been absorbed in victory, and they are certain of the reward and therefore made more firm and indubitable in faith by the degree of merit, the militant being in doubt and in gross bodies as shadows preceding. |
| 31 | Et licet tota dormientium multitudo sub infimo triumphantis exsistat tamquam purgatione indigentes, antequam ad patriam venire possint, tamen de tota peregrinantium graduatione non talis ordo ascendendi est, ut gradatim de infima militantium per dormientium quisque rapiatur et substituatur ultimo triumphantis, quoniam iste ascensus versus unionem ad verum caput fit velox et tardus, altus et bassus ex graduatione intrinsecae adhaesionis ex parte meriti vel demeriti dependentis ex cuiusque proprio arbitrio libero sibi concreato, ut quisque aeque gaudeat principiis illis, per quae in adoptionem filii dei pervenire possit, recte sicut ex infimo gradu aut sacerdotum aut laicorum ob benemerita quis absque graduationibus mediis ad praesidentiam aut ducalem aut archiepiscopalem vel altiorem rapitur. | And although the whole multitude of the sleeping subsists under the lowest triumphant as needing purification, before they can come to the fatherland, yet there is not such an order of ascending from the whole pilgrimage gradation, that each militant is gradually taken away and substituted in the last triumphant, since this ascent to union with the true head is swift and slow, high and low, depending on the intrinsic adhesion of merit or demerit, created by each one's free will, so that each may equally rejoice in the principles by which they may come to the adoption of the son of God, just as from the lowest grade of priests or laics, one is taken away without intermediate gradations to the presidency or duchy or archbishopric or higher. |
| 31 | Sed haec missa faciamus, ut ad viventium hominum ecclesiam nunc stilum convertamus. | But let us make this sacrifice, that we turn to the living church of men now. |
| 32 | Capitulum VI. | Chapter VI. |
| 32 | Est autem in hoc corpore ecclesiae concordantia investiganda in signaculo trinitatis, quoniam reperiuntur tres ordines magni in una mirabili conexione ad unum caput, Christum. | There is, however, in this body of the church, concordance to be investigated in the sign of the Trinity, since three great orders are found in one wondrous connection to one head, Christ. |
| 32 | Primo divinissimae concordantiae trinitatis et unitatis subalternatur sacramentorum conexio. | First, the connection of sacraments is subalternated to the most divine concordance of the Trinity and unity. |
| 32 | Secundo divinae concordantiae angelicae, qui sunt ministri divinae trinitatis, subalternatur sanctum sacerdotium, quoniam sacerdotes sunt ministri sacramentorum. | Second, the divine concordance of angels, who are ministers of the divine Trinity, is subalternated to the holy priesthood, since priests are ministers of sacraments. |
| 32 | Tertio subalternantur beatis spiritibus in patria homines fideles in via. | Third, the blessed spirits in heaven are subalternated to faithful men on the way. |
| 32 | Et sunt sacramenta illuminantia et purgantia, est sacerdotium pastorale purgatum et purgans, est fidelis populus, qui purgatur et non purgat ad instar angelicae et consequenter divinae trinitatis concordanti dispositione ordinata. | And there are illuminating and purging sacraments, there is the purified and purging pastoral priesthood, there is the faithful people, who are purified and do not purify, in the disposition of the concordant divine Trinity. |
| 32 | In sacramentorum admiranda hierarchia caput Christus se communicat cunctis in hac via exsistentibus sub figura et in aenigmate, quemadmodum viae convenit et mortalitati nostrae, sicut se in triumphanti facie ad faciem communicat absque aenigmate, quoniam ita convenit iuxta capacitatem utriusque status. | In the wondrous hierarchy of sacraments, Christ communicates with all existing in this way under figure and in enigma, as is fitting for the way and our mortality, just as he communicates face to face in the triumphant without enigma, since it is fitting according to the capacity of both states. |
| 33 | Et talis divina sacramentalis communicatio habet hierarchicum ordinem, quoniam tot sunt sacramenta, ut vult Augustinus ad Volusianum, qui dicit quod «nimis longum esset de varietate signorum disputare convenienter, quae, cum ad res divinas pertinent, sacramenta appellantur». | And such divine sacramental communion has a hierarchical order, since, as Augustine writes to Volusianus, there are so many sacraments that it would be unduly lengthy to discuss their variety adequately, which, since they pertain to divine things, are called sacraments. |
| 33 | Unde in tot et tantis sacramentis ita divinitus pro nostra salute impertitis, quoniam in unum Christum finaliter tendunt, ordo sanctus concordantialis usque in supremum sacramentum eucharistiae exsistit ad instar sicut in triumphanti omnis ordinatio tendit mirabili concordantia usque in Christum caput, per quem requiescit in deo aeternaliter omnis curia. | Thus, in these numerous and great sacraments, divinely administered for our salvation, all tending ultimately to Christ, there exists a holy concordant order up to the highest sacrament of the Eucharist, akin to how in a triumphant procession all arrangement culminates in wondrous concord culminating in Christ, the head, through whom eternal rest descends upon all the assembly in God. |
| 33 | Sic in hoc sacramento illius unici capitis Christi alia omnia sacramenta ut in fine quiescunt, cum sit «sacramentum sacramentorum». | Thus in this sacrament, the Head of Christ’s unique body, all other sacraments find their repose as if in an end, for it is called “the sacrament of sacraments.” |
| 33 | Omne etiam sacramentum imaginem trinitatis gestat, quoniam in quolibet est sacramentum tantum, est res tantum et res et sacramentum simul. | Every sacrament also bears the image of the Trinity, since in each is both sign and reality, reality and sacrament simultaneously. |
| 33 | Quis cunctam illam dulcem concordantiam ab ultimo signo in primum sacramentum et in intermediis et in quolibet per se investigare potest? | Who can adequately investigate that sweet concord from the last sign to the first sacrament and through all the intermediaries and each in itself? |
| 33 | Nullus pro certo. | None can do so with certainty. |
| 33 | Sufficiat ergo haec pauca tetigisse. | Therefore, it suffices to touch upon this briefly. |
| 34 | Subsequitur ordo sacerdotii, qui per sacramenta characterizatur, ut sit continuatio absque omni discissione media totius ecclesiae; et sic gestat sacerdotium signaculum sacramentalis indelebilis communionis ordinis sive concordantiae ad superiora divina. | Following is the order of the priesthood, characterized by sacraments, so that there is a continuous succession without any intermediary division in the entire church; thus, the priesthood bears an indelible sacramental seal of an order of communion or concord directed to the higher divine. |
| 34 | Et in hoc sacerdotio hierarchia est ordinata a pontificatu summo usque in laicum, quemadmodum magnus Dionysius ecclesiasticam hierarchiam describit. | And thus, in this priesthood, hierarchy is ordered from the highest pontificate down to the lay, as great Dionysius describes ecclesiastical hierarchy. |
| 34 | Et sicut homo constituitur ex spiritu, anima et corpore, ita sacramenta huius corporis ecclesiae sunt unus spiritus et sacerdotium anima et fideles ut corpus. | Just as man is constituted of spirit, soul, and body, so the sacraments of this mystical body of the Church are one spirit, the priesthood the soul, and the faithful the body. |
| 34 | Sicut enim anima partim adhaeret corpori et partim spiritui et est medium, per quod spiritus influit in corpus, ita et sacerdotium se habet ad fideles, quare totum sacerdotium est ut anima una in corpore uno fidelium. | For just as the soul adheres partly to the body and partly to the spirit, serving as the medium through which the spirit influences the body, so too the priesthood relates to the faithful, making the entire priesthood as one soul in one body of the faithful. |
| 34 | &laddUnde Gregorius Nazianzenus in Apologetico in principio, ubi loquitur de corpore ecclesiae quomodo constituitur ex regentibus et rectis dicit: «Alios pastores dedit et doctores ad perfectionem ecclesiae, eos videlicet, qui prae ceteris virtute animi praediti deo familiarius assistant et id officii in ecclesia gerant, quod vel anima in corpore vel mens et ratio operatur in anima, in quo quod deest et in quo abundat velut in membrorum diversitate consonantia facta per spiritum perfectum integrum atque aptum ad omnia corpus exsistat et dignum, quod Christum habeat caput». | For Gregory Nazianzen, in his Apologetic Oration at the beginning, where he speaks of the body of the Church constituted by rulers and the upright, says: “He gave others as shepherds and teachers for the perfection of the Church, namely, those endowed with superior spiritual power, intimately assisting God and performing their duties in the Church, as the soul acts in the body or mind and reason operate in the soul, where what is lacking is supplied and what abounds harmonizes through the perfect, complete, and suitable spirit as the body exists and is worthy to have Christ as its head.” |
| 34 | Haec ille. | This indeed. |
| 34 | &radd Quare sacerdotio convenit virtus regitiva, vivificativa, et illuminativa, quoniam sunt lux mundi et sal terrae. | Therefore, priesthood rightly corresponds to a regiving, vivifying, and enlightening power, for they are the light of the world and the salt of the earth. |
| 34 | Unde, ut dicit Cyprianus in epistula De aleatore, ideo sal terrae dicuntur sacerdotes, ut ex ipsis omnis fraternitas caelesti sapientia saliatur. | As Cyprian writes in the letter to the Lapsed, “since priests are called the salt of the earth, all fraternity is healed of heavenly wisdom through them.” |
| 35 | Et sunt hierarchicae ordinationes quoad animationem in sacerdotio in hac cura regitiva praesidentiali, quoniam, licet omnes supremae hierarchiae, qui episcopi sunt, quoad ordinem et pontificale officium aequales sint, est tamen discretio gradualis quoad regitivam curam. | There are hierarchical ordinations concerning animation within the priesthood in this pastoral care, regal and presidential, as even though all supreme hierarchy, who are bishops, are equal in order and pontifical duty, there is yet a gradual distinction in regal care. |
| 35 | Et in hac praesidentia hierarchia consideratur ex quadam concordantia, quae est in uno et pluribus. | This hierarchy is understood through a certain concord, which is both singular and manifold. |
| 35 | «Est enim unus tantum episcopatus, cuius quisque partem tenet», et ordo differentialis quoad praesidentialem curam. | “For there is but one episcopate, of which each holds a part” with an order that differentiates regarding presidential duties. |
| 35 | «Hoc utique erant alii omnes apostoli, quod erat Petrus, pari consortio honoris et potestatis praediti», sed Petrus praelatus est ceteris, ut sit unitas in concordantia, ut Cyprianus deducit ad Novatianum scribens. | “For all the apostles, indeed, were as Peter, endowed with equal partnership in honor and power, but Peter surpassed the rest to ensure unity in concord,” as Cyprian argues in his letter to Novatian. |
| 35 | Et Hieronymus contra Iovinianum dicit inter pares apostolos Petrum ad praesidendum electum, ut capite constituto schismatis tollatur occasio. | Jerome, against Jovinian, states that among the apostles, Peter was chosen to preside, to remove the occasion for schism under the constituted head. |
| 36 | Unde sicut episcopatus unus, ita una cathedra et una praesidentia gradualiter et hierarchice constituta. | Thus, just as one episcopate, so one chair and one presidency are gradually and hierarchically established. |
| 36 | De hac unitate cathedrae Optatus Milevitanus libro secundo contra Parmenianum, contra quem septem libellos scripsit, eleganter disputat cunctos catholicos episcopos unitatem cathedrae necessario tenere debere. | Optatus of Milevis, in Book II against Parmenian, elegantly argues that all Catholic bishops must necessarily uphold the unity of the chair. |
| 36 | Et quoniam haec praesidentia a Christo capite est propter vitare schisma et pacem fidelium et unitatem conservandam instituta, tunc habet suam graduationem ad instar dominiorum temporalium figurative. | And since this presidency from Christ the head is instituted to avoid schism, maintain peace among the faithful, and preserve unity, it has a gradation like that of temporal rulers metaphorically. |
| 36 | Unde hoc est animadvertendum secundum Hieronymum, quod, sicut exercitus sibi capitaneum constituit et ille tunc omnium consensum in se gestans una praesidentialis publica persona exsistit, ita et episcopus praesidens constituitur, 93 di. | Thus, as Jerome notes, just as a state has a public person appointed who gathers the consent of all, so the presiding bishop is constituted, 93 di. |
| 36 | Legimus. | Let us read. |
| 36 | Quare, «sicut res publica est communis res populi, et res communis est res civitatis, et civitas est hominum multitudo in quodlibet vinculum concordiae redacta», ut scribit Augustinus ad Volusianum De legum divinarum mutatione, ita se habet praesidens in cura pastorali ad instar illius, cui res publica commissa est. | Therefore, “as the state is a common affair of the people, and a common affair is the affair of the city, and the city is a multitude of people bound by concord in any covenant,” as Augustine writes to Volusianus in On the Change of Divine Laws, so the presiding bishop in pastoral care resembles one entrusted with the state. |
| 36 | Unde cuncti, qui subsunt curae, intelliguntur ita in praesidente uniti, ac si ipse esset anima una et ipsi corpus, quod anima haberet animare. | Therefore, all who are under his care are understood to be united with the president as if he were one soul animating a single body. |
| 37 | Unde tales ita uniti cum pastore ecclesiam constituunt, ut eleganter scribit Cyprianus ad Florentium et Pupianum, cuius pars habetur 7 q. | Thus, in such unity with the shepherd, they constitute the church, as Cyprian elegantly writes in his letter to Florentinus and Porphyrianus, of which a part is cited. |
| 37 | 1 Scire debes. | 1 You ought to know. |
| 37 | «Illi, inquiens, sunt ecclesia: plebs sacerdoti adunata et pastori suo grex adhaerens. | “These, he says, are the church: the assembly of presbyters united to their pastor, and the flock adhering to their shepherd.” |
| 37 | Unde scire debes episcopum esse in ecclesia et ecclesiam in episcopo. | Therefore, you ought to know that the bishop is in the church and the church in the bishop. |
| 37 | Et si quis cum episcopo non sit, in ecclesia non est». | And if anyone is not with the bishop, they are not in the church.” |
| 37 | Haec ille. | This indeed. |
| 37 | Idem dicit Cyprianus in epistula ad Cornelium De quinque presbyteris. | Cyprian says the same in his letter to Cornelius On Five Presbyters. |
| 37 | Unde sicut ecclesia universalis est corpus Christi mysticum, ita particulares ecclesiae mystica corpora suorum praesidentium, qui Christi legatione funguntur. | Thus, just as the universal church is the mystical body of Christ, so are the particular churches, mystical bodies of their presidents, functioning through Christ’s commission. |
| 37 | Sic Anastasius papa ad Ioannem Hierosolymitanum contra Rufinum scribens de ecclesia Romana loquens dicit: «Mihi curae non deerit evangelii fidem circa meos populos custodire partesque corporis mei per spatia diversa terrarum quantis possum litteris convenire, ne qua profanae interpretationis origo subrepat, quae devotas mentes immissa sui caligine labefactare conetur». | Thus Anastasius the pope, writing to John Hierosolymitanus against Rufinus concerning the Roman Church, states: “It will not be lacking to me to safeguard the faith of the Gospel among my peoples through letters as far as I can reach across varied terrains, lest some base origin of profane interpretation creep in and attempt to undermine devout minds enveloped in its obscurity.” |
| 37 | Haec ille. | This indeed. |
| 37 | Et concordat 19 di. | And it accords with 19 di. |
| 37 | Ita dominus. | Thus it is said. |
| 37 | Et haec est radix una propositi nostri, quod ecclesia est in episcopo per unionem. | And this is the root of our proposition that the church exists in the bishop through unity. |
| 37 | Et sic episcopus eos figurat et repraesentat, quia publica persona quoad istum concursum. | Hence, the bishop figures and represents them as a public person in that assembly. |
| 37 | Et hoc valebit pro sequentibus. | This will suffice for the following. |
| 38 | Habet autem graduationem suam ad instar ut Leo Nonus in epistula ad duos scribit Africae episcopos dicens: «Episcoporum ordo unus est, quamvis alii praeferantur aliis, sive ex eo, quod primas civitates et magis nominatas secundum potentiam aut leges saeculi obtinent, sive quod a sanctis patribus pro aliqua reverentia dignitatis aliquod privilegium dignitatis possident. | It has its own graduation, however, similar to what Leo IX writes in a letter to two bishops of Africa, saying: "The order of bishops is one, although some are preferred to others, either because they hold the first cities and more notable ones according to worldly power or laws, or because they possess some privilege of dignity from the holy fathers due to a certain reverence for dignity. |
| 38 | Nam sicut omnis mundana potestas hiis gradibus dignitatum a se invicem distat, id est, ut primus sit augustus vel imperator, deinde caesares, deinde reges, duces et comites atque tribuni, ita et ecclesiastica potestas ordinata a sanctis patribus invenitur dicente beato Clemente: In illis civitatibus, in quibus olim apud ethnicos primi flamines eorum atque primi legis doctores erant, primates vel patriarchae positi sunt, qui reliquorum iudicia et maiora negotia iuste diffinirent, qui etiam non uni provinciae, sed pluribus praeessent. | For just as all worldly power is distinguished from one another by these degrees of dignity, that is, so that the first is the emperor or augustus, then the caesars, then the kings, dukes, and counts, and tribunes, so also the ecclesiastical power, ordained by the holy fathers, is found, as Blessed Clement says: In those cities, where formerly among the pagans the first flamens and first doctors of the law were, the primates or patriarchs were placed, who would justly define the judgments and greater affairs of the rest, who would also preside not over one province, but over several. |
| 38 | Deinde ubi archiflamines erant paganorum, archiepiscopi constituti sunt Christianorum, qui singulis provinciis praeessent. | Then, where there were archflamens of the pagans, archbishops of the Christians were constituted, who would preside over individual provinces. |
| 38 | Ubi vero metropolis erat, quae interpretatur mater civitas, metropolitani erant, qui de tribus aut quattuor civitatibus intra aliquam provinciam maiori et matri aliarum civitatum praesidebant. | Where, indeed, there was a metropolis, which is interpreted as mother city, there were metropolitans, who would preside over three or four cities within some province, and would be the greater and mother of other cities. |
| 38 | Unde isti aliquando metropolitani tantum nominantur, aliquando archiepiscopi, si in ipsa provincia maiores aliqui non fuerint. | Whence these metropolitans are sometimes called only metropolitans, sometimes archbishops, if there are no greater ones in the same province. |
| 38 | Ubi autem minores civitates habuerunt tantum flamines vel comites, episcopi sunt constituti. | Where, however, smaller cities had only flamens or counts, bishops were constituted. |
| 38 | Porro tribuni plebis non impune intelliguntur presbyteri sive reliqui inferioris ordinis clerici. | Moreover, the tribunes of the people are understood to be presbyters or other clerics of a lower order, not without penalty. |
| 38 | Hiis omnibus divino et humano iure praelatus est pontifex Romanus». | All these are subject to the pontiff of Rome by divine and human law. |
| 38 | Haec ille. | He says this. |
| 38 | Haec etiam sententia est Anacleti, Clementis, Anicii, Iulii et aliorum Romanorum pontificum. | This is also the opinion of Anacletus, Clement, Anicius, Julius, and other Roman pontiffs. |
| 39 | Et est multum notanda talis applicatio, quoniam ex ea constat, quod praesidentialis ecclesiastica potestas superaddita sit temporali quemadmodum anima corpori; sic quod, ubi fuit temporalis coadunatio in regimine terreno, superadditum est per viam pacis et concordiae directiva praesidentia in Christum, ut cuncta in unum caput potestatis supremae convenienti medio reducerentur. | And it is very noteworthy, such an application, since from it it is clear that the presidential ecclesiastical power is superadded to the temporal, just as the soul is to the body; so that, where there was a temporal coadunation in earthly rule, a directive presidency in Christ was superadded through the way of peace and concord, so that all things might be reduced to one head of supreme power through a convenient medium. |
| 39 | Restat alio loco istud dictum melius ponderare; nunc fundamentalia quaedam tangamus. | It remains to weigh this statement better in another place; now let us touch on some fundamentals. |
| 39 | Deinde de sacerdotio singulariter. | Then, concerning the priesthood, singularly. |
| 40 | Capitulum VII. | Chapter VII. |
| 40 | Superius, cum de ordinibus et choris hierarchicis diceremus, diximus, quod ad instar sicut in tota hierarchia est supremum, medium et infimum, ita et in suprema parte cuiuslibet hierarchiae creatae inveniuntur ordines varii, quousque ad unum primum illius ordinis perveniatur. | Above, when we were speaking about the orders and choirs of the hierarchy, we said that, just as in the whole hierarchy there is a supreme, middle, and lower part, so also in the supreme part of any created hierarchy, various orders are found, until one arrives at the first order of that hierarchy. |
| 40 | Recte sicut in angelica sunt tres ordines et in primo ordine iterum sunt tres chori. | Just as in the angelic hierarchy there are three orders, and in the first order, there are again three choirs. |
| 40 | Et licet in quolibet choro ad hunc modum graduatio inveniatur, tamen hoc nunc intendo ad hoc, ut una continua concordialis conexio per totam hierarchiam inveniatur ordinatissime. | And although in each choir a graduation of this kind is found, nevertheless, I now intend this, so that one continuous, concordial connection is found throughout the hierarchy, in an orderly manner. |
| 40 | Tunc ultimus chorus est primi ordinis, licet primi ordinis illuminatio ita in eo incommunicabiliter persistat, ut ipsius ibi fluxus terminetur, tamen adhuc ille chorus est subsequentis primi alterius ordinis ita praelatione conexus, ut absque radio primi ordinis sibi actualiter radium sufficientem secundo ordini communicet, ut sic sit unus continuus dulcis tonus in ordine graduali continuo. | Then, the last choir of the first order, although the illumination of the first order persists in it incommunicably, so that its flux is terminated there, nevertheless, that choir is connected to the subsequent first choir of the second order by prelation, so that without the ray of the first order, it communicates a sufficient ray to the second order, so that there is one continuous, sweet tone in the gradual order. |
| 40 | Ex quo trahe, ad instar quod ordo primus ad imaginationem sit, 21 gradus spiritualis illuminationis, qui sunt adeo activi et redundantes in primo choro, quod se nituntur communicare secundo, sed non possunt in totum, sic 20 tantum recipit secundus chorus. | From which, I draw, similarly, that the first order is, as it were, 21 degrees of spiritual illumination, which are so active and redundant in the first choir, that they strive to communicate to the second, but cannot entirely, so the second choir receives only 20. |
| 40 | Et ille receptos non potest communicare totaliter, unde communicat 19. | And it cannot communicate what it has received entirely, whence it communicates 19. |
| 40 | Et quia in tribus punctis luminis consistit ordo, tunc non potest amplius infimus chorus in eodem ordine communicare, quare quoad ordinem pure passive se habet. | And because the order consists of three points of light, then the lowest choir in the same order cannot communicate further, and so it has itself purely passively. |
| 40 | Unde 18 puncta, quae potest communicare, transeunt in ordinem inferiorem et sic successive usque ad ultimum chorum tertii ordinis, qui habebit 12. | Whence the 18 points that it can communicate pass to the lower order, and so successively, until the last choir of the third order, which will have 12. |
| 41 | Et ex hoc nota, quod, quia deus est lux infinita, tunc omnis lux extra deum creata finita comparative ad deum umbra infinitae lucis censetur. | And from this, note that, since God is infinite light, then all created light outside of God is considered finite, and, in comparison to God, it is considered the shadow of infinite light. |
| 41 | Et tanto plus umbrae habet, quanto a deo distat, licet in patria lumen aeternum divinum sufficientissime iuxta omne desiderium quemlibet spirituum irradiando complectatur. | And it has more shadow, the more it is distant from God, although in the homeland, the eternal divine light sufficiently irradiates and embraces every spirit, according to every desire. |
| 41 | Sic in nostro proposito in ordinibus religionis et illius partis ecclesiae, quae spiritualior censetur, sunt novem chori ab episcopali choro usque ad monachalem. | So, in our proposal, concerning the orders of religion, and that part of the church which is considered more spiritual, there are nine choirs, from the episcopal choir to the monastic. |
| 41 | Et supremus ordo constituitur ex episcopali, sacerdotali et diaconali, totus sacer. | And the supreme order consists of the episcopal, priestly, and diaconal, all sacred. |
| 41 | Medius ex subdiaconali, acolytali et exorcistali, mixtus. | The middle order consists of the subdiaconal, acolytal, and exorcistal, mixed. |
| 41 | Infimus ex lectorali, ostiariali et tonsorali, non sacer. | The lower order consists of the lectoral, ostiariatal, and tonsoral, not sacred. |
| 41 | Iterum ex diaconali, subdiaconali et acolytali ordo comparativus concordantialis plus permixtus sanctitate, quoniam duos sacros habet choros. | Again, the comparative and concordant order, consisting of the diaconal, subdiaconal, and acolytal, is more mixed with sanctity, since it has two sacred choirs. |
| 41 | Iterum ex sacerdotali, diaconali et subdiaconali ordo sacer sub primo tamen ordine constitutus. | Again, the sacred order, consisting of the priestly, diaconal, and subdiaconal, is constituted under the first order. |
| 41 | Et sic de aliis mixturis. | And so concerning other mixtures. |
| 41 | Monachatus autem ad tonsoralem chorum conectitur, quoniam est ut medium inter laicos et clericum. | Monasticism, however, is connected to the tonsoral choir, since it is, as it were, a medium between the laity and the cleric. |
| 42 | Capitulum VIII. | Chapter VIII. |
| 42 | Similiter iuxta superiora et virtus regitiva, ex qua praesidentialitas et pastoralis cura oritur, habet suos ordines, quoniam ex papali, patriarchali et archiepiscopali constituitur primus ordo. | Similarly, according to the above, and the ruling virtue, from which presidentiality and pastoral care arise, has its own orders, since the first order consists of the papal, patriarchal, and archiepiscopal. |
| 42 | Secundus ex episcopali, archidiaconali et decanali. | The second order consists of the episcopal, archidiaconal, and decanal. |
| 42 | Tertius ex sacerdotali, diaconali et subdiaconali. | The third order consists of the priestly, diaconal, and subdiaconal. |
| 42 | Et habet inter se suas permixtas graduationes et subalternas conexiones. | And it has among itself its own mixed graduations and subalternate connections. |
| 42 | Cur autem talis graduum diversitas necessario pro conservatione universi exsistat ad instar sicut in caelestibus, ut magnus eam differentiae ordo servaret, habetur 89 di. | But why such a diversity of degrees necessarily exists for the conservation of the universe, just as in the celestial, so that a great order of difference is preserved, is had in 89 days. |
| 42 | Ad hoc. | To this end. |
| 42 | In tota etiam cathedrali unitate hoc est advertendum, quod totum sacerdotium ecclesiam et corpus unum constituit, cuius quidem sacerdotii ordo est ut anima et spiritus sanctus spiritus. | Also, in the entire cathedral unity, this is to be noted, that the whole priesthood constitutes the church and one body, whose order is, as it were, the soul and the Holy Spirit. |
| 42 | Constituitur ergo ecclesia sacerdotalis ex corpore, anima et spiritu. | Therefore, the church is constituted sacerdotally from the body, soul, and spirit. |
| 42 | Et quoniam spiritus sanctus per characterem ordinis sacerdotalia perficit, tunc sanctum est sacerdotium. | And since the Holy Spirit perfects the sacerdotal through the character of the order, then the priesthood is holy. |
| 42 | Quod autem spiritus sanctus operetur in sacerdote, iam superius per Augustinum libro secundo contra epistulam Parmeniani ostensum est et per Albertum Magnum late super symbolo in opere De officio missae ac per alios paene omnes doctores. | That the Holy Spirit operates in the priest, has already been shown above through Augustine, in the second book against the epistle of Parmenian, and through Albert the Great, extensively, on the symbol, in the work "On the Office of the Mass", and through almost all other doctors. |
| 43 | Unde licet multi &ladddoctores&radd sacerdotes schismatici et haeretici sint et fuerint, Christi tamen sententia verax est, qui sacerdotium sanctum usque ad saeculi consummationem in ipso et se in ipso dixit permansurum. | Whence, although many doctors and priests are schismatic and heretical, and have been, nevertheless, the true sentence of Christ is, who said that the holy priesthood would remain in Him and in Himself until the end of the world. |
| 43 | Quare corpus sacerdotale, licet caducum et mortale et deviabile in membris, non tamen in toto, quando semper maior pars in fide et lege Christi permaneat, ut hoc Cyprianus eleganter deducit ad Novatianum, ubi dicit: «Licet omnis homo mendax, dominus tamen verax. | Wherefore, the priestly body, although caducous and mortal and deviable in its members, is not, however, in the whole, when always the greater part remains in the faith and law of Christ, as Cyprian elegantly deduces to Novatian, where he says: "Although every man is a liar, the Lord, however, is true. |
| 43 | Quare confessorum pars maior et melior stat in fidei suae robore ac lege et disciplina dominicae veritatis. | Wherefore, the greater and better part of the confessors stands in the strength of their faith and the law and discipline of the Lord's truth. |
| 43 | » Et sicut «per casum Iudae dignitas aliorum apostolorum non est diminuta, ita etiam propter casum aliquorum sacerdotum a fide alii dignitatem non perdunt». | " And just as "the dignity of the other apostles is not diminished through the fall of Judas, so also the dignity of other priests is not lost due to the fall of some priests from the faith". |
| 43 | Haec ille. | He says this. |
| 43 | Ex quo ad nostrum propositum fundamentum non parvum elicio, quod maior pars sacerdotum in fide et lege persistit. | From which, I elicit a foundation not small for our proposal, that the greater part of priests persists in faith and law. |
| 43 | Et haec est altera radix magna ad subsequentia. | And this is the second great root for what follows. |
| 44 | Capitulum IX. | Chapter IX. |
| 44 | Deinde in praesidentialitate hoc considerandum, quod ipsa habet suum signaculum ex angelico spiritu, ex cathedra et corpore. | Then, concerning the presidency, this is to be considered, that it possesses its own mark from the angelic spirit, from the chair and the body. |
| 44 | Quoniam sicut sacerdotii potestas ab ipsa trinitate robur capit et sancto spiritu regitur per medium characteris ordinis, quia sacerdotium summo sacerdoti subalternatur et primae divinae concordantiae, sic praesidentialitas, quae ex sacerdotio fluit descensive et comparative ad fideles per dispensationem, subalternatur hierarchiae angelicae, et ad angelicam virtutem sacerdotium per medium cathedrae conectitur. | Because, just as the power of the priesthood derives strength from the Trinity itself and is governed by the Holy Spirit through the medium of the order's character, since the priesthood is subordinate to the supreme priest and the first divine concordance, so the presidency, which flows from the priesthood downward and comparatively to the faithful through dispensation, is subordinate to the angelic hierarchy, and the priesthood is connected to angelic virtue through the medium of the chair. |
| 44 | Praesidere et praeferri angelos ecclesiis iam ex Apocalypsi manifestum est, ac etiam rei publicae et principatibus doctores catholici tenent ex illis, quae angelus ad Danielem locutus est, qui dixit: «Ego veni propter sermones tuos. | That presidents and superiors of angels over churches is already evident from Revelation, and also Catholic doctors hold this concerning the republic and principalities from what the angel spoke to Daniel, who said: "I came because of your words." |
| 44 | Princeps autem Persarum restitit mihi 21 diebus. | But the prince of the Persians resisted me for 21 days. |
| 44 | Et ecce Michael, unus de principibus primis, venit in adiutorium mihi. | And behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to my aid. |
| 44 | » Et paulo post: «Nunc revertar, ut proelier adversus principem Persarum. | "And shortly after: "Now I shall return to fight against the prince of the Persians." |
| 44 | Cum enim egrederer, apparuit princeps Graecorum veniens». | "For when I departed, the prince of the Greeks appeared, coming." |
| 44 | Et dicit sanctus Gregorius: «Quos, inquit, alios principes gentium nisi angelos dicimus? | And Saint Gregory says: "Whom, he says, do we call other princes of the nations but angels? |
| 44 | Quia circa angelorum mysteria dispensanda singulis quibusque gentibus angeli sunt praelati et uni populo diversi. | Because concerning the mysteries of angels, angels are placed over each and every nation, and diverse ones over a single people. |
| 44 | Quoniam populo Iudaeorum captivo in Perside angelus, qui Danieli loquebatur, praelatus fuit, et Michael alteri Iudaeorum populo non captivo. | Because an angel who spoke to Daniel was placed over the captive people of the Jews in Persia, and Michael over the other, non-captive, people of the Jews. |
| 45 | Unde patet praelationem istam sanctam angelicis spiritibus conecti per medium cathedrae. | Hence, this holy preeminence is connected to angelic spirits through the medium of the chair. |
| 45 | Quare sacerdotium ita ad praesidentiam relatum habet suae praesidentiae animam, scilicet cathedram, et spiritum, scilicet angelum, ad instar prioris. | Therefore, the priesthood, in such a way related to the presidency, has the soul of its presidency, namely, the chair, and the spirit, namely, the angel, in the manner of the former. |
| 45 | Unde ex hoc trahitur, quod veritas praesidentiae et cathedrae ex hoc est infallibilis, ut Augustinus De correctione Donatistarum tractando hoc dictum Christi: Super cathedram Moysi, declarat, licet multi pestilentiales in cathedris saepe sedeant. | Hence, from this is derived that the truth of the presidency and the chair is infallible, as Augustine, in treating of the correction of the Donatists, declares this saying of Christ: "Upon the chair of Moses," although many pestilential ones often sit in chairs. |
| 45 | Et ex hoc surgit alia magna radix propositi nostri, quomodo veritas cathedrae assit. | And from this arises another great root of our purpose, how the truth of the chair is present. |
| 46 | Capitulum X. | Chapter X. |
| 46 | Tertio consideratur sacerdotium quoad officium intercessionale, et hoc modo oritur officium ex ordine et praesidentia permixtim. | Thirdly, the priesthood is considered with regard to its intercessory office, and in this way the office arises from the order and presidency mixed together. |
| 46 | Et tunc subordinatur beatis spiritibus in patria, qui fusas orationes ex officio ex ordine et praesidentia resultato offerunt pro illis, quibus funduntur. | And then it is subordinated to the blessed spirits in the homeland, who offer up blended prayers from the office resulting from order and presidency for those for whom they are poured out. |
| 46 | Et haec operatio ex hac continuatione per officium sanctum suscipitur, licet persona offerentis accepta non sit. | And this operation is received from this continuation through the holy office, even though the person offering it is not accepted. |
| 46 | Et in hoc consideratur radix, quomodo oratio sacerdotii acceptior est, quia continuatur per officium ad sanctos, qui in patria sunt, et sic penetrat usque in veritatem, quae Christus est. | And in this is considered the root of how the prayer of the accepted priesthood is more acceptable, because it is continued through the office to the saints who are in the homeland, and thus penetrates even to the truth, which is Christ. |
| 46 | Et haec sunt notanda. | And these things are to be noted. |
| 46 | De hoc dicit Hostiensis in Summa de remissione circa finem: «Una est ecclesia, cuius pars militat in terris, et in caelis alia triumphat. | On this, Hostiensis says in the Summa de remissione near the end: "One is the Church, of which one part fights on earth, and another triumphs in heaven." |
| 46 | Et tota ecclesia desiderat animas devotas adiuvari, De poenitentia di. | And the whole Church desires the devout souls to be aided, De poenitentia, di. |
| 46 | 1 Hii duo». | 1 These two. |
| 46 | Et notat ibidem, quod «tria sunt in ecclesia, quae semper retinent suam efficaciam, a quocumque etiam peccatore fiant, scilicet virtus verborum, virtus sacramentorum et desiderium ecclesiae, 15 q. | And he notes there that "three things are in the Church, which always retain their efficacy, no matter by what sinner they are done, namely, the virtue of words, the virtue of sacraments, and the desire of the Church, 15 q. |
| 46 | fi. | fi. |
| 46 | c. | c. |
| 46 | fi. | fi. |
| 46 | , 13 q. | , 13 q. |
| 46 | 2 Pro obeuntibus. | 2 For the dying. |
| 46 | Deus enim ad supplicationem triumphantis et suffragia militantis movetur». | For God is moved by the supplication of the triumphant and the prayers of the militant." |
| 46 | Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 47 | Quia nunc habemus, quomodo veritas sacerdotii radicatur in triplici caelesti concordantia, ad divinam continuatur per ordinem, &laddunde Gregorius Nazianzenus in Apologetico dicit sacrosancta mysteria ad instar caelestis imaginis celebrari, per quae utique in terris adhuc positi caelestibus ordinibus sociamur. | Because now we have how the truth of the priesthood is rooted in the threefold heavenly concordance, is continued to the divine through the order, and further, Gregory Nazianzen in his Apologetic says that the most holy mysteries are celebrated in the likeness of a heavenly image, through which we, still placed on earth, are associated with heavenly orders. |
| 47 | Continuatur&radd ad angelicam per cathedram et ad beatos in patria per officium. | It is continued to the angelic through the chair and to the blessed in the homeland through the office. |
| 47 | Et sic sacerdotium est ut anima una in uno corpore fidelium, quae membris communicat vivificationem, vegetationem et sensationem. | And thus the priesthood is like a single soul in one body of the faithful, which communicates vivification, vegetation, and sensation to the members. |
| 47 | Et iuxta graduationem membrorum, quibus praesidet, gradum in praesidentia cathedrali sortitur. | And according to the gradation of the members over which it presides, it attains a degree in the presidential chair. |
| 47 | Corpus autem ex principatu mundi compaginatur gradatim, cuius caput est res publica Romana. | But the body is composed gradually from the principality of the world, of which the Roman Republic is the head. |
| 47 | Unde hierarchias illas mundanas corporis, ordines et choros facile quis ex superioribus habere potest. | Hence, one can easily have those worldly hierarchies of the body, orders, and choirs from the superiors. |
| 47 | Quare brevitatis causa supersedeo &laddnunc in tertia parte de hoc dicturus. | Therefore, for brevity's sake, I omit this, intending to speak about this in the third part. |
| 47 | &radd | &radd |
| 48 | Et hoc tantum est tenendum animo, quod, sicut anima residens in capite aequiparatur pontifici Romanae civitatis, cuius res publica supremum locum mundi obtinet, ita residens pariformiter gradatim in aliis membris alios pontifices repraesentat iuxta graduationem et notam Leonis Noni suprapositam. | And this only is to be held in mind, that, just as the soul residing in the head is likened to the pontiff of the Roman city, whose republic holds the highest place in the world, so likewise the residing pontiffs represent other members in a similar manner, according to the gradation and the note of Leo the Ninth placed above them. |
| 48 | Et sufficiat pro nunc cum Cypriano ad Rogatianum scire, quomodo «una est ecclesia per totum mundum in multa membra divisa et unus episcopatus multorum concordi numerositate diffusus». | And it is sufficient for now, with Cyprian to Rogatianus, to know how "one is the Church throughout the whole world, divided into many members, and one episcopate diffused by the concordant multitude of many." |
| 48 | Et quod, qualiscumque ille est, «qui in illa non est, extra Christum, vitam et veritatem, est», ut ipse ait. | And that, whoever is not in it, is outside Christ, life, and truth, as he himself says. |
| 49 | Post praemissa oportet investigare, quae verba Christi ad ecclesiam et apostolorum successores trahi debent, ut in illis fundetur radix ecclesiasticae potestatis. | After the foregoing, it is necessary to investigate what words of Christ should be drawn to the Church and the successors of the apostles, so that the root of ecclesiastical power may be founded in them. |
| 50 | Capitulum XI. | Chapter XI. |
| 50 | Nunc videndum est de hiis, quae ex praemissis solidis fundamentalibus considerationibus elici possunt ad cognoscendum viam in dubiis, quae in ecclesia oriri possent. | Now it is necessary to see what can be elicited from the foregoing solid fundamental considerations for knowing the way in doubtful matters that might arise in the Church. |
| 50 | Et primo ad verba Christi, quae locutus est apostolis, sententiam Augustini ad Esitium De die novissimo notemus, quia dicit: Verba, quae locutus est Christus ad apostolos, oportet de successoribus intelligere, sicut illud: «Eritis odio omnibus gentibus propter nomen meum, et illud: Eritis mihi testes in Iudaea et Samaria et usque ad extremum terrae, sicut illud: Ecce ego vobiscum sum omnibus diebus usque in saeculi consummationem». | And first, concerning the words of Christ that he spoke to the apostles, let us note the opinion of Augustine to Esitium De die novissimo, because he says: The words that Christ spoke to the apostles, it is necessary to understand concerning the successors, just as that: "You will be hated by all nations because of my name," and that: "You will be my witnesses in Judea and Samaria and even to the uttermost part of the earth," just as that: "Behold, I am with you in all days until the consummation of the age." |
| 50 | Quod tamen eum universae ecclesiae promisisse, quae aliis morientibus, aliis nascentibus usque in saeculi consummationem futura est, quis non intelligat? | Which, however, that he promised to the whole Church, which will be in other dying, others being born, until the consummation of the age, who does not understand? |
| 50 | «Sicut eis et illud ait, quod ad eos omnino non pertinet, et tamen sic dictum est, tamquam ad solos eos pertineat: Cum videritis abominationes etc. | "Just as he said to them that it does not pertain to them at all, and yet it was said as if it pertained only to them: When you see abominations, etc. |
| 50 | , et: Cum videritis haec, scitote etc. | , and: When you see these things, know, etc." |
| 50 | Haec ille. | This he said. |
| 51 | Ex quo considerandum, quod verba Christi ad apostolos trahi debent ad ecclesiam. | From which it is to be considered that the words of Christ to the apostles should be drawn to the Church. |
| 51 | Et in hoc adverti debet, quod aliquando Christus voluit ecclesiae aperire mysteria tamquam ecclesiae unitae, aliquando tamquam dispersae. | And in this, it should be noted that sometimes Christ wished to reveal mysteries to the Church as a united Church, sometimes as a dispersed one. |
| 51 | Et quoniam Petrus senior erat inter apostolos, quem ideo ob vitandum schisma et pacem conservandam apostolis praetulit, ut dicit Hieronymus libro primo contra Iovinianum, tunc Christus Petrum praepositum apostolorum saepe alloquitur ut principem in unitate totam ecclesiam sibi commissam figurantem et repraesentantem, nam non dubium, ecclesia universalis claves habet ligandi et solvendi, dum unita est. | And because Peter was senior among the apostles, whom he therefore preferred to the apostles to avoid schism and preserve peace, as Jerome says in the first book against Jovinian, then Christ often addresses Peter, the preeminent apostle, as the prince, forming and representing the whole Church entrusted to him in unity, for there is no doubt that the universal Church has the keys of binding and loosing, while it is united. |
| 51 | Et non reperitur, quod alibi Christus sibi tradiderit, nisi ibi ad Petrum loquendo: «Tibi dabo claves,» et: «Quodcumque ligaveris etc. | And it is not found that elsewhere Christ gave them to himself, except there, speaking to Peter: "I will give you the keys," and: "Whatever you bind, etc." |
| 51 | Hoc Augustinus 22 capitulo De agone Christiano prosequitur, similiter illud dictum Christi: Petre, «rogavi pro te, ut non deficiat fides tua,» et illud: «Portae inferi non praevalebunt adversus eam. | This Augustine pursues in the 22nd chapter of De agone Christiano, similarly that saying of Christ: Peter, "I prayed for you that your faith may not fail," and that: "The gates of hell will not prevail against it." |
| 51 | » Unde quia, ut dicit Ambrosius 50 di. | "Hence, because, as Ambrose says in 50 di. |
| 51 | Fidelior, Petrus pro soliditate ecclesiae petra dictus est, et ex eo petra, «quia ipse primus in nationibus fidei fundamentum posuit et tamquam saxum immobile totius operis christiani compagem molemque contineat», ideo Christus de ecclesia loqui volens ad eum tamquam ipsam figurantem loquitur. | Fidelior, Peter was called the rock for the solidity of the Church, and from that rock, "because he first laid the foundation of faith among the nations and, like an immovable stone, contained the structure and mass of the whole Christian work," therefore, Christ, wishing to speak of the Church, speaks to him as if representing it. |
| 51 | Ideo ecclesiae privilegia solida ex hiis, quae Christus tradidit et promisit et locutus est Petro, haurire debemus. | Therefore, we must derive the solid privileges of the Church from those things that Christ gave, promised, and spoke to Peter. |
| 52 | Et ut breviter aliqua tangantur, epistulam, quam Alipius, Augustinus et Fortunatus ad Generosum scripserunt, notemus, ubi habetur: «Evangelizatum est enim tibi per vocem ipsius domini Iesu Christi, quod omnibus gentibus annuntiabitur evangelium eius, et tunc erit finis. | And briefly touching on some matters, we note the letter that Alipius, Augustinus, and Fortunatus wrote to Generosum, where it is stated: "Indeed, it has been proclaimed to you by the very voice of the Lord Jesus Christ that the gospel of his will be proclaimed to all nations, and then will be the end." |
| 52 | Evangelizatum est tibi per prophetas et apostolicas litteras, quod Abrahae dictae sunt promissiones et semini eius, quod est Christus, cum ei diceret deus: In semine tuo benedicentur omnes gentes. | It has been proclaimed to you by prophets and apostolic letters that the promises made to Abraham, which is Christ, were said to him when God said: "In your seed all nations shall be blessed." |
| 52 | Has ergo promissiones tenenti si tibi angelus de caelo diceret: Dimitte christianitatem orbis terrae et tene partem Donati,... | Therefore, if an angel from heaven were to tell you to abandon Christianity to the whole world and to hold onto the part of Donatus,... |
| 52 | anathema esse debet, quia te a toto praecidere et in partem contrudere conaretur et alienare a promissis dei. | It should be anathema, because he would attempt to separate you from the whole and to divide you into a part and alienate you from the promises of God. |
| 52 | Si enim ordo episcoporum sibi succedentium considerandus est, quanto certius vere et salubriter ab ipso Petro numeramus, cui totius ecclesiae figuram gerenti dominus ait: Super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam, et portae inferorum non vincent eam? | If the order of bishops succeeding one another is considered, how much more surely and healthily we count ourselves from him Peter, to whom the Lord said: "Upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it?" |
| 52 | Petro enim successit Linus, Lino Cletus etc. | Peter was succeeded by Linus, Linus by Cletus, etc. |
| 52 | et Melchiades Eusebio. | and Melchiades by Eusebius. |
| 52 | In illo autem ordine, qui ducitur a Petro usque Anastasium, qui hodie est et in eadem cathedra sedet, etiam si quisnam traditor per illa tempora subrepisset, nihil praeiudicat ecclesiae et innocentibus christianis. | In that order, which leads from Peter to Anastasius, who sits today in the same chair, even if anyone who was a traitor during those times had crept in, nothing prejudices the church or the innocent Christians. |
| 52 | Cui dominus praevidens ait de praepositis malis: Quod dicunt facite, quae faciunt, facere nolite; dicunt enim et non faciunt, ut certa sit spes fidelis, quae non in homine, sed in domino collocata numquam tempestate sacrilegi schismatis dissipetur». | To the evil prelates, the Lord foresaw and said: "What they say, do; what they do, do not do; for they say and do not do, so that the faithful hope may be certain, which is not in man, but in the Lord, never dispersed by the tempest of sacrilegious schism." |
| 52 | Haec ibi. | Here. |
| 53 | Capitulum XII. | Chapter XII. |
| 53 | Pulchra documenta sunt in praetacta complexa epistula. | Beautiful documents are found in the aforementioned complex letter. |
| 53 | Primo, quod ecclesia vera est illa, quae est catholica et diffusa, et quod ipsa diffundetur ante diem iudicii per universum orbem. | First, that the true church is the one that is catholic and widespread, and that it will be spread throughout the world before the day of judgment. |
| 53 | Haec etiam Augustinus latissime in epistula ad Esitium De die novissimo. | Augustine also widely states this in his letter to Esitius On the Last Day. |
| 53 | Unde licet dies iudicii extremi non veniat nisi prius antichristus, et licet sancti, ut Cyprianus, Lactantius varia scribant de fine mundi et antichristi adventu, immo Cyprianus eum proxime suo tempore venturum credidit, ut scribit in duabus epistulis ad Demetrianum et Fortunatum, tamen, an Christus in medio temporis venerit, et an mundus septem milibus annorum curriculis, ut Lactantius in septimo libro Institutionum videtur opinari, vel quando hoc eveniat, penitus incertum est. | Therefore, although the day of judgment's end has not yet come unless first the Antichrist, and although the saints, such as Cyprian, Lactantius, write various things about the end of the world and the coming of the Antichrist, indeed, Cyprian believed that he would come soon in his time, as he writes in two letters to Demetrianum and Fortunatum, yet, whether Christ came in the midst of times, and whether the world will run its course for seven thousand years, as Lactantius seems to think in the seventh book of Institutes, or when this will happen, it is altogether uncertain. |
| 53 | Quia Christus ad apostolos, qui ecclesiam constituebant, dixit: «Non est vestrum noscere tempora vel momenta, quae deus in sua posuit potestate». | Because Christ told the apostles, who were constituting the church, "You are not to know the times or the moments that the Father has placed in his own authority." |
| 53 | Hoc tamen scimus ex apostolo ad Thessalonicenses secundum sanctum Hieronymum ultima quaestione ad Algaziam, quod prius totum Romanum imperium debet desolari et discessio ab eo fieri, sic quod omnes subiacentes ei ab eo recedent. | However, we know from the apostle to the Thessalonians second according to Saint Jerome in the last question to Algazia, that before the whole Roman empire is desolated and secession from it happens, so that all who are subject to it will depart from it. |
| 53 | Et similiter secundum Glossam super illis verbis Pauli discessio ab oboedientia Romanae sedis quoad ecclesiasticos fieri debet ante ipsius antichristi adventum, ut hoc multi doctores dicunt. | And similarly according to the Gloss on those words of Paul, secession from the obedience of the Roman seat regarding ecclesiastical matters should happen before the coming of the Antichrist, as many teachers say. |
| 53 | Unde ex hoc dicto et hodierna dispositione papatus et imperii discretus et sagax non multum temporis superesse arguit. | Therefore, from this said and today's disposition of the papacy and the empire, a discerning and sagacious person does not argue that much time remains. |
| 53 | Tamen licet persecutio et multa de hiis malis, quae praecedere debent, hodie videantur, scimus tamen, quod nondum statim finis, licet sint signa finis. | Yet, although persecution and many of these evils that should precede seem to be visible today, we know that the end is not yet, although these are signs of the end. |
| 53 | Sed oportet, ut nomen domini et ecclesia per totum mundum et omnes insulas dispergatur. | But it is necessary that the name of the Lord and the church be scattered throughout the whole world and all islands. |
| 54 | Quare Augustinus adventum Christi in nubibus tempore persecutionis non in superficie litterae de adventu eius in die iudicii, sed subtiliori penetratione de adventu Christi in ecclesiam dicit intelligendum exponens, quomodo «in nubibus» ecclesiae cum potestate magna tempore persecutionis veniet, «et tunc mittet angelos suos et congregabit electos», de quo per eum late in praefata epistula ad Esitium. | Therefore, Augustine understands the coming of Christ in the clouds during the time of persecution not in the literal sense of the coming of his advent on the day of judgment, but in a subtler penetration of the coming of Christ in the church, saying "in the clouds" of the church with great power will come during the time of persecution, "and then he will send his angels and gather the elect," as he explains through him widely in the aforementioned letter to Esitius. |
| 54 | Haec alibi latissime in Libello inquisitionis veri et boni prosecutus sum concludens plus 600 annis de tempore superesse, ac hoc tempore ad reformationem mundum disponi debere. | He concludes elsewhere in the Treatise on the Investigation of the True and Good, that more than 600 years remain from that time, and that during this time the world should be prepared for reformation. |
| 54 | O deus, si hoc nostro tempore levare possemus capita nostra et videre, quod appropinquaret redemptio nostra, quia videmus ecclesiam numquam ad eum casum devenisse, in quo nunc est. | O God, if we could lift up our heads in this time and see that our redemption is approaching, because we see that the church has never come to such a state as it is now. |
| 54 | Vellet deus in sacra synodo Basiliensi electos suos esse congregatos et in tanta adversitate et perplexitate in nubibus ibi congregatis ostendere adventum maiestatis suae. | God would have wanted his chosen ones to be gathered in the holy synod of Basel and to show the coming of his majesty among them gathered in the clouds there. |
| 55 | Capitulum XIII. | Chapter XIII. |
| 55 | Habetur itaque solidum refugium in dubiis omnibus ex suprascripta epistula, quoniam haec est catholica ecclesia verae fidei, quae minus coarctata loco et diffusior per orbem. | Therefore, a solid refuge is found in all doubts from the aforementioned letter, because this is the catholic church of true faith, which is less constricted by place and more widespread throughout the world. |
| 55 | Ita Optatus secundo libro contra Parmenianum, quomodo de Roma et Melchiade papa, Materno Agrippinensi, Rethico Augustodunensi, Marino Arelatensi et aliis 19 episcopis Eunomius et Olympius in Africam missi Carthagine 40 diebus steterunt, et de studio partium strepitus cotidiani sunt habiti, et novissima sententia ferebatur catholicam ecclesiam esse, quae per orbem est diffusa. | Therefore, Optatus in the second book against Parmenian, how the bishops from Rome and Melchiade the pope, Materno of Agrippina, Rethicus of Augustodunum, Marinus of Arelate, and others 19 bishops who were sent by Eunomius and Olympius to Africa stayed in Carthage for 40 days, and daily disputes were held among the parties, and the latest decision was that the catholic church was the one that was widespread throughout the world. |
| 55 | De hoc et Augustinus et Cyprianus et sancti patres scripta nobis maxima reliquerunt. | About this, Augustine and Cyprian and the holy fathers left us many writings. |
| 55 | Unde ex hoc elicitur, quia fides nostra hodierna est concordans cum ea fide, quae fuit illis temporibus per orbem diffusa, necessario vera est, quia una est fides invariabilis. | Therefore, from this it is inferred that our faith today is in agreement with the faith that was widespread in those times throughout the world, necessarily true, because the faith is one and unchangeable. |
| 55 | Licet de ducentis et quinque episcopis, qui in Africanis partibus commorarunt et se in conciliis subscripserunt, nullus christianus sit, neque in orientalibus partibus, tamen inter tot schismata et varias haereses in fide christiana nostra haec unica vera fides diffusior est quam aliqua secta schismaticorum aut haereticorum. | Although 250 and five bishops who stayed in the African provinces and subscribed to the councils, none of them is a Christian, nor in the eastern provinces, yet among all the schisms and various heresies in the Christian faith, this one true faith is more widespread than any sect of schismatic or heretical groups. |
| 55 | Unde ex hoc unico argumento omnis haeretica pravitas victa iacet. | Therefore, from this single argument, all heretical perversion is defeated. |
| 56 | Capitulum XIV. | Chapter XIV. |
| 56 | Deinde habetur Petrum figuram ecclesiae gessisse, contra quam portae inferi non praevalebunt. | Then it is held that Peter represented the figure of the Church, against which the gates of hell will not prevail. |
| 56 | Et hanc sententiam omnes prisci patres et fatentur et rationibus astruunt. | And this opinion all the ancient Fathers both acknowledge and demonstrate with arguments. |
| 56 | De hoc infra latius habetur. | On this matter, more will be said below. |
| 56 | Insuper, quod una est cathedra vera et certa sancti Petri, in qua sedent omnes successores. | Moreover, there is one true and certain chair of Saint Peter, in which all his successors sit. |
| 56 | Unde, cum una cathedra sit privilegium unius ecclesiae et primum secundum Optatum libro secundo contra Parmenianum, tunc est verum, quod non adhaerens unitati cathedrae extra unitatem ecclesiae est, 93 di. | Hence, since one chair is the privilege of one Church and is first, according to Optatus in his second book against Parmenianus, then it is true that he who does not adhere to the unity of the chair is outside the unity of the Church, 93 di. |
| 56 | Qui cathedram. | He who holds the chair. |
| 56 | Dicit autem conformiter Optatus loco praescripto: «Cathedra una est et negare non potes scire te in urbe Roma Petro primo cathedram esse collatam, in qua sederat omnium apostolorum caput, Petrus, unde et Cephas appellatus est, in quo uno cathedrae unitas ab omnibus servaretur, ne ceteri apostoli singulas sibi quisque defenderet, ut iam schismaticus esset, qui contra unam cathedram alteram sibi collocaret. | He says similarly, as Optatus states in the prescribed place: "There is one chair, and you cannot deny that you know that the first chair was given to Peter in the city of Rome, in which sat the head of all the apostles, Peter, from whom he was also called Cephas, in which one chair the unity of the chair is preserved by all, so that the other apostles might not each defend their own, so that whoever placed another chair opposite the one chair would be a schismatic." |
| 56 | Ergo cathedra unica, quae est prima de dotibus, et in ea sedit prior Petrus. | Therefore, the single chair, which is first in gifts, and in which Peter sat first. |
| 56 | Successit Linus, Lino Clemens, cui Analectus etc. | Linus succeeded, then Linus was succeeded by Clement, to whom Anacletus etc. |
| 56 | , Damaso Siricius, qui hodie noster est socius. | , Damasus by Siricius, who is our present associate. |
| 56 | » Et infra: «Contra portas inferi claves salutares legimus Petrum, principem nostrum, recepisse, cui a Christo dictum est: Tibi dabo claves. | » And below: "We read that Peter, our prince, received the salutary keys against the gates of hell, to whom it was said by Christ: To you I will give the keys. |
| 56 | Unde est ergo, quod claves regni vobis usurpare contenditis, qui contra cathedram Petri vestris praesumptionibus et audaciis sacrilege militatis? | Hence, what is it, then, that you contend to use the keys of the kingdom, who wage sacrilege with your presumption and boldness against the chair of Peter? |
| 56 | etc. | etc. |
| 56 | » «Igitur de dotibus ecclesiae cathedra est prima, quam probavimus per Petrum nostram esse, quae ducit ad se angelum». | » "Therefore, the chair is first among the gifts of the Church, which we have proved to be ours through Peter, which draws to itself the angel." |
| 56 | Angelus enim, qui datur ecclesiae, ei non coniungitur, qui se cathedrae Petri non coniungit. | For the angel given to the Church is not joined to one who does not unite himself to the chair of Peter. |
| 56 | Et infra: «Vos dico esse abscisos palmites a vite, vos rivum conscisum a fonte. | And below: "I say that you are branches cut off from the vine, you a stream cut off from the source. |
| 56 | Non enim potest origo esse rivus, qui parvus est et non de se nascitur, et arbor a ramo consciso; exsectus enim arescit. | For a stream cannot be the origin, which is small and not born of itself, and a tree cut off from a branch; for it withers when cut off. |
| 56 | » Haec ille. | » These are his words. |
| 56 | Magna sunt ista documenta, quoniam non est nisi una cathedra per descensum succedentium usque in Petrum, supra quem ecclesia fundata, consideranda, quoniam certi sumus quod portae inferi non praevalebunt adversus eam. | These are great testimonies, for there is only one chair to be considered, descending through the succession down to Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, for we are certain that the gates of hell will not prevail against it. |
| 56 | Unde ex hoc notandum quod, qui se Christianum esse fatetur, necessarie confiteri habet conexam esse cathedram suam ad succedentium cathedram sancto Petro et in societate illius cathedrae per unionem esse, alioquin christianus non est etc. | Hence, from this it must be noted that whoever claims to be a Christian necessarily must confess that his chair is in communion with the chair of the successors of Saint Peter and that he is united to it by society, otherwise he is not a Christian etc. |

| 56 | Qui cathedram cum multis similibus. | He who holds the chair with many similar ones. |
| 57 | Est itaque verum unam esse cathedram Petri, quoniam cathedra principatum regitivum significat in ecclesia. | Therefore, it is true that there is one chair of Peter, for the chair signifies a ruling principality in the Church. |
| 57 | Et sicut in ipsa cathedra Petri tres primi patriarchae leguntur sedisse, scilicet Romanus, Alexandrinus et Antiochenus, ita et cum illis omnes subiecti episcopi. | And just as in that very chair of Peter three of the first patriarchs are said to have sat, namely the Roman, the Alexandrian, and the Antiochene, so too all the subordinate bishops are subject to them. |
| 57 | Unde dicit sanctus Gregorius papa in Registro 199 epistula ad Eulogium Alexandrinum: «Suavissima mihi sanctitas vestra multa in epistulis de sancti apostolorum principis Petri cathedra locuta est dicens, quod ipse in ea nunc usque in suis successoribus sedeat, sed me quidem ego indignum esse non solum in numero sedentium, sed etiam stantium agnosco. | Hence, Saint Gregory the Pope says in the Register, letter 199 to Eulogius the Alexandrian: "Your most holy sanctity has spoken much to me in your letters about the chair of the prince of the apostles, Peter, saying that he sits in it even now in his successors, but I certainly recognize myself as unworthy not only to be numbered among those who sit, but even among those who stand. |
| 57 | Sed cuncta, quae dicta sunt, in eo libenter accepi, quod ille mihi de cathedra locutus est, qui Petri cathedram sedet. | But I received all that was said with great pleasure, because he who spoke to me about the chair is the one who sits on the chair of Peter. |
| 57 | » Et infra: «Unde, cum multi sint apostoli, pro ipso tamen principatu sola apostolorum princeps sedes in auctoritate convaluit, quae in tribus locis unius est. | » And below: "Hence, although there are many apostles, yet only the prince of the apostles has his chair strengthened in authority, which is one in three places. |
| 57 | Ipse enim sublimavit sedem, in qua etiam quiescere et praesentem vitam finire dignatus est. | For he himself exalted the seat, in which he was also honored to rest and to end his present life. |
| 57 | Ipse decoravit sedem, in qua evangelistam discipulum misit. | He himself adorned the seat, in which he sent the evangelist disciple. |
| 57 | Ipse firmavit sedem, in qua septem annis, quamvis discessurus, sedit. | He himself established the seat, in which he sat for seven years, although he was about to depart. |
| 57 | Cum ergo unius atque una sit sedes, cui ex auctoritate divina tres episcopi nunc praesident, quidquid ego de vobis boni audio, hoc mihi imputo; si quid de me boni creditis, hoc vobis imputate, quia in illo unum sumus, qui ait: Ut omnes unum sint, sicut et tu pater in me et ego in te, et ipsi in nobis unum sint. | Since, therefore, the seat is one and the same, to which three bishops now preside by divine authority, whatever good I hear about you I reckon to myself; if you believe anything good about me, reckon it to yourselves, for in him we are one, who says: That they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You, and they in Us may be one. |
| 57 | » Haec ibi. | » These are his words. |
| 57 | Et est epistula singulariter notanda, quoniam in una Petri cathedra sedent tres episcopi principes, quorum sublimior est Romanus. | And this letter is particularly noteworthy, for in the one chair of Peter three principal bishops sit, of whom the Roman is the higher. |
| 57 | Et sicut omnes episcopi ad has sedes tempore Nicaeni concilii et ante coniungebantur, et post illa tempora omnes episcopi ab illis post hoc egressi sunt, sic est omnium episcoporum unius episcopatus una cathedra, in qua primo sedet Romanus. | And just as all bishops were united to these seats in the time of the Nicene Council and before, and after that time all bishops who have since emerged have come from them, so the one chair of all bishops is one, in which the Roman bishop sits first. |
| 58 | Et iterum, licet aliqui, ut Liberius, Honorius et alii, in cathedra Petri aliquamdiu sedentes in errorem schismaticum seducti ceciderint, sedes tamen absque vitio remansit. | And again, although some, like Liberius, Honorius, and others, who for a time sat in the chair of Peter, were seduced into schismatic error and fell, the chair itself remained without fault. |
| 58 | Maximum est istud, quod menti tenendum esse censeo, quia haec est certa regula et secura firmitas, quod sedes, quae originem receperunt a sede Romana, cum qua tamquam filiae uniuntur, una sedes sive cathedra censentur, licet tam in successione directa in linea recta Romanorum pontificum quam collateralium certi pontifices in haeresim ceciderint. | This is of great importance, which I believe must be held as true, for this is a certain rule and secure firmness, that the seats which have received their origin from the Roman seat, united to it as daughters, are considered one seat or chair, even though certain bishops in the direct line of the Roman popes or in collateral lines have fallen into heresy. |
| 58 | Ab Abraham enim in Christum generationes per Matthaeum secundum lineam nominantur; licet non omnes in linea sancti fuerint, Christus tamen per eandem attingebatur. | For from Abraham to Christ, the generations are named in Matthew according to the line; even though not all in the line were holy, yet Christ was reached through the same line. |
| 58 | Sic in ecclesia, cuius haec est figura, Christus per rectam lineam pontificum attingitur malitia mediorum praesulum non obstante. | So in the Church, whose figure this is, Christ is reached through the line of the popes, despite the malice of intermediate prelates. |
| 58 | Est enim ipsa linea sive cathedra sancta indefectibiliter duratura usque ad saeculi consummationem. | For the line itself or chair is holy and will endure indefectibly until the end of the age. |
| 58 | Unde qui se in Christiana fide esse putant, de illis est regula Cypriani infallibilis, quod maior pars semper in fide et veritate legis persistit, et quicumque se ab illa separat, ab ecclesia fidelium se separat. | Hence, those who think they are in the Christian faith are subject to the infallible rule of Cyprian, that the greater part always remains in the faith and truth of the law, and whoever separates from it separates from the Church of the faithful. |
| 58 | Unde Cyprianus ad Florentium et Puppianum: «Quid enim, si exciderint quidam a fide; numquid infidelitas eorum fidem Dei evacuavit? | Hence, Cyprian to Florentius and Puppanius: "What then, if some have fallen away from the faith; does their unbelief destroy the faith of God? |
| 58 | Absit. | Far be it. |
| 58 | Est enim Deus verax, omnis homo mendax. | For God is true, and every man a liar. |
| 58 | Et ut legitur in evangelio, cum eum loquentem discipuli derelinquerent, conversus ad duodecim dixit: Numquid et vos vultis ire? | And as it is read in the Gospel, when the disciples were leaving him, turning to the twelve he said: Do you also want to go away? |
| 58 | Respondit ei Petrus, dixit: Domine, ad quem ibimus? | Peter answered him, saying: Lord, to whom shall we go? |
| 58 | Verbum vitae aeternae habes. | You have the words of eternal life. |
| 58 | Et nos credimus et cognovimus, quia tu es filius Dei vivi. | And we have believed and have come to know that you are the Son of the living God. |
| 58 | Loquitur illic Petrus, supra quem aedificata fuit ecclesia, docens, quia, etsi contumax et superba obaudire nolentium multitudo discedat, ecclesia tamen a Christo non recedit, et illi sunt ecclesia, plebs sacerdoti et pastor gregi adunata. | There Peter speaks, on whom the Church was built, teaching that although a stubborn and proud multitude who refuse to listen may depart, the Church does not depart from Christ, and they are the Church, the people gathered under the priest and the shepherd under the flock. |
| 58 | » Haec ille. | » These are his words. |
| 59 | Bona est haec doctrina, quia Petrus ut ecclesiam repraesentans nomine totius ecclesiae locutus est. | This teaching is good, for Peter, representing the Church, spoke in the name of the whole Church. |
| 59 | Et tamen de ecclesia multi exciderunt, immo de apostolis Iudas. | And yet many have fallen away from the Church, indeed even from the apostles, like Judas. |
| 59 | Quare illi ecclesiam veram fidelium constituunt, qui inter Christi fidem se habere putantes maiorem partem constituunt et se suo pastori Petro coadunant et eius cathedrae. | Therefore, those who constitute the true Church of the faithful are those who, thinking themselves to be in Christ's faith, constitute the greater part and unite themselves to their own shepherd Peter and to his chair. |
| 59 | Hanc sententiam ex superioribus manifestam relinquens pauca diffusius subnectere de hac re curabo. | Leaving the above statement clear, I will now briefly add a few more things on this matter. |
| 59 | Nam licet Christus rogaverit, ut non deficeret fides Petri, qui pro sua reverentia exauditus est, et licet hoc exponatur de fide ecclesiae, tamen etiam per aliquos, puta Albertum Magnum super eodem passu, de fide Petri et eius successoribus intelligitur, quia in eis finaliter non deficiet. | For although Christ prayed that Peter's faith would not fail, and he was heard for his reverence, and although this is explained as referring to the faith of the Church, yet also by some, for instance Albertus Magnus on the same passage, it is understood to refer to the faith of Peter and his successors, for in them it will finally not fail. |
| 59 | Per alios autem, ut Gorra exponit, intelligitur de fide Romanae ecclesiae. | But by others, as Gorra explains, it is understood to refer to the faith of the Roman Church. |
| 60 | Capitulum XV. | Chapter XV. |
| 60 | Pro clariori intellectu intenti nostri revocemus ad memoriam superius tacta secundum sanctum Cyprianum et Leonem Nonum, scilicet, quod quisque praesidens gradum praesidentiae sortitur secundum locum, cui praesidet, et eius &laddloci&radd leges vel privilegia, et deinde, quod praesidens ita totam ecclesiam figurat sibi unitam, quod Cyprianus eam esse dicit in praeside. | For a clearer understanding of our intention, let us recall what was touched upon above, according to Saint Cyprian and Leo IX, namely, that each president obtains the degree of presidency according to the place over which he presides, and its laws or privileges; and then, that the president thus figures the whole church as united to himself, so that Cyprian says that it is in the president. |
| 60 | Quoad primum dicimus, quia, ut scribit Ambrosius 2 q. | As for the first point, we say that, as Ambrose writes. |
| 60 | 7 Beati, «Roma principatum et caput obtinet nationum», et ita actum est divino nutu, ut, «ubi erat caput superstitionis, ut illic caput sanctitatis quiesceret». | 7 Blessed are they, "Rome holds the principality and headship of nations," and it was so done by divine will, that "where the head of superstition was, there the head of holiness might rest." |
| 60 | Ergo Romanus episcopus eum gradum praesidentiae habet, quem habuit apud ethnicos Roma. | Therefore, the Roman bishop holds the degree of presidency which Rome held among the pagans. |
| 60 | De hoc 80 di. | On this, 80 says. |
| 60 | Urbes secundum Lucium papam et secundum Clementem c. | Cities, according to Pope Lucius and according to Clement. |
| 60 | In illis eiusdem di. | In those, the same says. |
| 60 | Et talis ordinatio fuit divinitus inspirata secundum Leonem in c. | And such an arrangement was divinely inspired, according to Leo in. |
| 60 | Illud eiusdem di. | That same says. |
| 60 | , de quo etiam 99 di. | , on which also 99 says. |
| 60 | Provinciae. | Provinces. |
| 61 | Deinde privilegium divinum Petrum praetulit aliis concurrente tamen electione apostolorum secundum Anacletum et secundum Hieronymum libro primo contra Iovinianum. | Then the divine privilege preferred Peter to others, yet with the concurrent election of the apostles, according to Anacletus and according to Jerome in the first book against Jovinian. |
| 61 | Sed ex superioribus secundum Augustinum successores Petri in eadem cathedra sedent; ergo privilegium cathedrae aequale nunc et tunc. | But from the foregoing, according to Augustine, Peter's successors sit in the same chair; therefore, the privilege of the chair is equal now and then. |
| 61 | Quare ita ut Petrus princeps fuit apostolorum, ita et Romanus pontifex episcoporum princeps, quoniam in locum apostolorum episcopi succedunt. | Wherefore, just as Peter was the prince of the apostles, so also the Roman pontiff is the prince of bishops, because bishops succeed to the place of the apostles. |
| 61 | De hoc infinita quasi habentur sanctorum scripta. | On this, there are almost infinite writings of the saints. |
| 61 | Unde iste principatus est super omnes homines in ecclesia exsistentes, quae per fidem constituitur. | Whence this principality is over all men existing in the church, which is constituted through faith. |
| 61 | Est enim capitaneus in eo exercitu. | For he is a captain in that army. |
| 61 | Ita enim scribit Leo imperator ad Theodosium et Valentinianus augustus ad Theodosium: «Beatissimus Romanae civitatis episcopus, cui principatum sacerdotii super omnes antiquitas contulit, locum habeat ac facultatem de fide iudicare. | For thus Leo the emperor writes to Theodosius, and Valentinian Augustus to Theodosius: "Let the most blessed bishop of the Roman city, to whom antiquity has conferred the principality of the priesthood over all, have the place and the power to judge concerning the faith." |
| 61 | » Et infra: «Hac enim gratia et secundum solempnitatem conciliorum et Constantinopolitanus episcopus eum per libellos appellavit propter intentionem, quae orta est de fide. | And below: "For by this grace, and according to the solemnity of councils, the Constantinopolitan bishop also appealed to him by letters because of the question which arose concerning the faith." |
| 61 | » Item Marcianus et Valentinianus Leoni, archiepiscopo Romae, gloriosae civitatis: «Tuam sanctitatem principatum in episcopatu divinae fidei possidentem»; de hoc 12 di. | Likewise Marcian and Valentinian to Leo, archbishop of Rome, of the glorious city: "Your holiness possessing the principality in the episcopate of the divine faith"; on this, 12 says. |

| 61 | 3 Aliorum, quod omnis fidelis papae submittitur, dum totius corporis caput esse designetur, scilicet in fide, quia corpus ex fidelibus constituitur. | 3 Of others, that every faithful person is subject to the pope, while he is designated as the head of the whole body, namely, in faith, because the body is constituted of the faithful. |
| 61 | Sic dicit Hieronymus ad Damasum et in 10. | Thus Jerome says to Damasus and in 10. |
| 61 | quaestione De cathedra: «Si quis cathedrae Petri adhaeret, meus est». | question On the chair: "If anyone adheres to the chair of Peter, he is mine." |
| 61 | Et tamen hoc iudicium fidei non est semper in nutu unius Romani pontificis diffinibile, quia haereticus esse posset, de quo inferius dicetur; immo in illo iudicio fidei, in quo principatus eius consistit, concilio catholicae ecclesiae subest. | And yet this judgment of faith is not always definable at the will of one Roman pontiff, because he could be a heretic, which will be discussed below; rather, in that judgment of faith, in which his principality consists, he is subject to the council of the Catholic Church. |
| 62 | Capitulum XVI. | Chapter XVI. |
| 62 | Unde est advertendum, quod Romana ecclesia capitur pro sede aliquando et communiter, et fuere ab antiquo tempore Nicaeni concilii tres sedes, silicet Romana, Alexandrina et Antiochena, licet Heliae sive Hierosolymorum episcopus semper honoraretur, ut habetur 6 c. | Whence it is to be noted that the Roman church is sometimes and commonly taken for the see, and from ancient times there were three sees of the Nicene council, namely, Roman, Alexandrian, and Antiochene, although the bishop of Elia or Jerusalem was always honored, as is found in 6 c. |
| 62 | concilii Nicaeni, &ladd19 di. | of the Nicene council, 19 says. |

| 62 | Quoniam mos et 22 di. | Because custom and 22 says. |
| 62 | Sacrosancta. | Most holy. |
| 62 | Unde post hoc etiam sedes Hierosolymorum et Constantinopolitana in gestis conciliorum inveniuntur. | Whence after this also the sees of Jerusalem and Constantinople are found in the acts of councils. |
| 62 | Unde Constantinopolitanus quodam particulari concilio ante Calcedonense, quia nova Roma, se universalem patriarcham nominavit, quoniam illae quinque patriarchales sedes vocantur, 22 di. | Whence the Constantinopolitan, by a particular council before Chalcedon, because it was New Rome, called itself universal patriarch, because those five patriarchal sees are called, 22 says. |
| 62 | Diffinivimus. | We have defined. |
| 62 | Huiusmodi materia quaestionis in Calcedonensi concilio legitur expedita, quoniam allegantibus hincinde tam vicariis apostolicae sedis quam patriarcha Constantinopolitano canonibus iuxta decretum iudicum concilii diffinitum fuit sedem apostolicam primatum tenere debere, quia antiqua Roma, et Constantinopolitanam secundum locum, quia nova Roma, 22 di. | This matter of the question is read as settled in the Chalcedonian council, because with arguments on both sides, both by the vicars of the apostolic see and by the patriarch of Constantinople, according to the canons, it was defined by the decree of the judges of the council that the apostolic see ought to hold the primacy, because it is old Rome, and Constantinople the second place, because it is New Rome, 22 says. |
| 62 | De Constantinopolitanae, licet Constantinopolitanus eisdem gaudeat primatiae privilegiis, 22 di. | Of Constantinople, although the Constantinopolitan enjoys the same privileges of primacy, 22 says. |
| 62 | Renovantes. | Renewing. |
| 62 | Et licet Leo papa tunc multis scripturis nisus fuerit retractare illam partem diffinitionis, quod Constantinopolitanus secundum locum habere deberet, quia obviabat constitutionibus Nicaeni concilii, quas infringibiles scribit, tamen ita usus obtinuit longo tempore. | And although Pope Leo then, relying on many writings, tried to retract that part of the definition, that the Constantinopolitan ought to have the second place, because it contradicted the constitutions of the Nicene council, which he writes are inviolable, yet that usage prevailed for a long time. |
| 62 | Unde in gestis universalium conciliorum post subsecutorum semper praecedit Constantinopolitanus Alexandrinum, 22 di. | Whence in the acts of the universal councils after the successors, the Constantinopolitan always precedes the Alexandrian, 22 says. |
| 62 | Renovantes et c. | Renewing and c. |
| 62 | sequens, et De privilegiis Antiqua. | following, and On the Privileges of the Ancient. |
| 62 | Et has quinque sedes reperio in gestis octavi concilii universalis Constantinopolitani septima actione quinque capita ecclesiae nominatas, et vocantur sedes apostolicae 1 q. | And I find these five sees in the acts of the eighth universal council of Constantinople, in the seventh session, five heads of the church named, and they are called apostolic sees 1 q. |
| 62 | 7 Convenientibus, et in eis sedentes etiam papae vocantur, ut ibidem in § Item Tharasius. | 7 With those agreeing, and those sitting in them are also called popes, as there in § Item Tharasius. |
| 62 | Quomodo autem sint capita censenda, infra dicetur. | How, however, they are to be considered heads, will be said below. |
| 62 | Et sicut papa Romanus saepe vocatur patriarcha, ut in gestis conciliorum, praesertim octavi universalis, habetur paene per totum, sic etiam alii patriarchae papa vocantur, ut notat glossa 40 di. | And just as the Roman pope is often called patriarch, as is found in the acts of councils, especially the eighth universal one, almost throughout, so also other patriarchs are called pope, as the gloss notes 40 says. |
| 62 | Si papa et textus 22 q. | If pope and text 22 q. |
| 62 | 2 Sane § Item: Si Romanorum. | 2 Truly § Item: If of the Romans. |
| 62 | Sed non multum ad propositum. | But not much to the purpose. |
| 63 | Hoc nunc notandum apostolicam sedem primatum tenere super omnes, 22 di. | This is now to be noted, that the apostolic see holds the primacy over all, 22 says. |
| 63 | De Constantinopolitana, et Hincmarus, archiepiscopus Remensis capitulo 15 contra &laddLaudunensem&radd scribit ex brevi ponderosa diffinitione Nicaeni concilii qua dixit, antiquitas teneat omnem talem ordinationem graduationum, quae apud ethnicos fuit in primatiis, esse diffinitam spiritu sancto &laddinspirante&radd. | Of Constantinople, and Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, in chapter 15 against the Laudunensis writes from the weighty brief definition of the Nicene council which said that antiquity holds all such arrangement of gradations, which was among the pagans in the primacy, to be defined by the inspiring Holy Spirit. |
| 63 | Et eapropter diffinitio Calcedonensis concilii dicit secundum canones Romanum primatum habere, sed canonem illum antiquitas teneat in suis privilegiis, ut, quae fuit graduatio principatus in civitatibus ethnicis et eorum archiflaminibus et aliis, ibi remaneat ille gradus. | And therefore the definition of the Chalcedonian council says that according to the canons the Roman holds the primacy, but that antiquity holds that canon in its privileges, so that whatever was the gradation of principality in the pagan cities and their chief priests and others, that degree remains there. |
| 63 | Sed non dubium in capitolio Romano pontificem maximum in Iovis templo praepositum; ita et gratiae tempore. | But there is no doubt that in the capitol the Roman pontiff was the chief priest in the temple of Jupiter; so also in the time of grace. |
| 63 | Unde Placidia augusta filio augusto scribens dicit: «Quia Roma maxima civitatum et domina omnium terrarum, ideo Petrus in ea principatum ordinavit divini episcopatus. | Whence Placidia Augusta, writing to her son Augustus, says: "Because Rome is the greatest of cities and mistress of all lands, therefore Peter ordained in it the principality of the divine episcopate." |
| 63 | » Et quod ex dispositione illa civitatum antiqui primatias arguebant, patet in disputatione 12 actionis Calcedonensis concilii, ubi episcopum Nicaenum super Basianopolim ex curia praelatum fuisse multis argumentis ex hoc fundamento convincere nititur arguens, et in primo capitulo Tauritani concilii diffinitum est: «Qui probaverit suam civitatem metropolim esse vel fuisse, teneat primatum». | And that from that arrangement of cities the ancients argued for primacy, is clear in the disputation of the 12th session of the Chalcedonian council, where it tries to convince by many arguments from this foundation that the bishop of Nicaea was promoted from the court over Basianopolim, and in the first chapter of the Tauritan council it was defined: "He who proves his city to be or to have been a metropolis, let him hold the primacy." |
| 64 | Ecce primatum ex civitate disponi et ortum capere primarium. | **Ecce, primus** - Behold, the first |
| 64 | Diffinitio enim 150 patrum ac etiam post hoc Calcedonensis concilii super praelatione sedis Constantinopolitanae post Romanam habet illam causam dicens: «Etenim sedi senioris Romae propter imperium civitatis illius digne patres privilegia reddiderunt, eadem intentione promoti 120(! | **Difficile est** - It is difficult |
| 64 | ) reverendissimi episcopi aeque sanctae sedi novae Romae privilegia tribuerunt rationabiliter iudicantes imperio et senatu urbem ornatam aeque senioris Romae privilegiis frui et in ecclesiasticis sicut illam maiestatem habere negotiis et secundam post illam exsistere. | **Quod est praesidium** - That which is a stronghold |
| 64 | » Ecce argumentum vix solubile, quod in Calcedonensi concilio approbatur. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Et licet imperatores privilegia dederint exemptionis certis praelaturis, semper tamen hoc ius antiquitatis exceptum et salvum remansit, ut ibidem. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Unde quantum hoc dictum veritati innitatur, ex hoc poterit deprehendi, quia, si ex sanctitate primi praesidentis aut loci reverentia sedium primitivitatem arguere deberemus, non dubium Hierosolymorum prima foret, quoniam ibi pontifex maximus ecclesiam lavit in sanguine suo. | **Unde est hoc?** - Whence is this? |
| 64 | Ibi etiam sedes Iacobi apostoli, primi archiepiscopi, ut legitur prima actione octavi universalis concilii, de cuius cathedra Eusebius libro septimo c. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | 16 scribit eleganter. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Scriptores etiam super canonicis epistulis eapropter Iacobi praelatas asserunt, quia primam Hierosolymorum sedem habuit, quae fuit prima christianitatis. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Sicut et Paulus Iacobum praeponit, cum de ecclesiae columpnis loqueretur. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Deinde Alexandrina non sortitur ex primo praeside secundum locum, quia Marcus non praefertur sancto Ioanni dilectissimo, et Marcus Alexandriae, Ioannes Ephesi sedebat. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Nec tamen praefertur Ephesus Alexandriae quoad dignitatem episcopatus, quia Alexandria vicit Ephesum saeculi dignitate. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 64 | Tamen ambo, scilicet non tantum saeculi dignitatem, sed et divinam causam aliam concurrisse in hiis sedium praeeminentialibus causis credendum est, ut ad idem de Antiochena sede scribit Innocentius papa ad Alexandrum, ubi dicit: «Unde advertimus non tam pro magnificentia civitatis hoc eidem attributum, quam quod prima primi apostoli sedes esse monstretur». | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 65 | Tamen, etsi a principio ita fuit, quod secundum loci dignitatem dignitas ecclesiastica sit distributa per sacra concilia et sanctos patres, non tamen propter accrescentiam dignitatis temporalis, nisi ordinatio concilii interveniret, crescit dignitas episcopi loci. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 65 | Unde, quando Acatius dixit se episcopum regiae civitatis esse et propter hoc dignitatem suam ita esse magnam, quod ab apostolico praesule iudicari non possit, scribit Gelasius papa ad episcopos per Dardaniam se risisse hoc, dicens: «Numquid apud Mediolanum, apud Ravennam, apud Sirmium, apud Treveros multis temporibus non constitit imperium? | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 65 | Numquid harum urbium sacerdotes ultra mensuram sibimet antiquitus deputatam quippiam suis dignitatibus usurparunt? | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 65 | » Ubi de hoc plura. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 65 | Idem de hoc Anastasius papa Alexandrino episcopo in epistula, quae incipit: Honos et honor, quae dicit Antiochenam Romanae cessisse, et quod non secundum voluntatem imperatorum, sed pristinum provinciarum morem metropolitanos episcopos debere nominari, de quo 10 di. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 65 | § Imperiali. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 66 | Et quia de istis plura supra tacta sunt, concludendum aestimo Romanam sedem ob saeculi dignitatem et divinum privilegium et in augmentum fidei, ut pax servaretur, et ob tot experimenta sanctissimorum praesulum, quorum successive plus quam triginta propter fidem martyrio coronabantur, per conciliorum statuta primatum merito possidere. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Capitulum XVII. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Capitur autem aliquando ecclesia Romana pro proxime unitis Romanae ecclesiae, sicut in libello Leonis Noni contra praesumptiones Michaelis Constantinopolitani c. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | 32, ubi dicit Romanam ecclesiam esse ut «cardo, in quo volvitur ostium ecclesiae, et stabile semper manebit». | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Et eius clerici propter propinquitatem ad cardinem dicuntur cardinales. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Et Constantinus imperator Agathoni papae, ut in principio gestorum sexti universalis concilii legitur, scribit, ut mittat tres personas de sua ecclesia et duodecim metropolitanos de toto suo concilio. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Unde potest ex hoc consideratio haberi, quod aliquando sedes apostolica pro pontifice Romano capitur, aliquando ecclesia Romana pro papa et suae dioecesis clericis et fidelibus, aliquando pro omnibus sub sua metropoli et sede archiepiscopali constitutis. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Ita enim legitur in multis universalibus conciliis vocatus archiepiscopus Romanus aliquando pro omnibus etiam metropolitanis ecclesiis sibi tamquam patriarchae et capiti in sede patriarchali praesidenti unitis, ut in septima actione octavi universalis concilii, ubi de sententia concilii Romani loquitur, dicit vicarius patriarchae Hierosolymorum: «Spiritus sanctus, qui locutus est in Romanorum ecclesia, locutus est et in nostra», aliquando pro omnium fidelium ecclesia, quae ad ipsam Romanam ut ad caput unitur. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Unde cum dicitur Romanam ecclesiam numquam errare posse, hoc est verum de tota universali ecclesia ultimo modo capta. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Et deinde de patriarchali Romana ecclesia etiam est verum. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Deinde de archiepiscopali est verum. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 67 | Deinde de episcopali est verum finaliter. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 68 | Sed istae veritates graduationem habent, quoniam prior est infallibilis et fuit et erit semper, secunda est hodie infallibilis eo respectu, quia universalis ecclesia quasi totaliter sub patriarchatum Romanum est redacta. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 68 | Deinde consideratione sedium patriarchalium tunc etiam est verior fides semper sub patriarchatu Romano, et ita fuit et erit, licet universalis ecclesiae in se maior sit promissione Christi firmitas. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 68 | Deinde sedis archiepiscopalis urbis Romanae fidei veritas est adhuc plus fallibilis et adhuc plus episcopalis, licet a principio fidei patriarchalis Romanae ecclesiae inter omnes patriarchales, archiepiscopalis inter omnes archiepiscopales et episcopalis inter omnes episcopales maior securitas et minor fallibilitas fuit. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 68 | Et ita erit usque in diem ultimum, quoniam, ut legitur in gestis octavi universalis concilii, Bahanis famosissimus praepositus curiae et patricius dixit, quomodo patriarchales sedes successive descrescendo redigi deberent usque ad unum patriarchatum, et per illum iterum deus alios patriarchatus revocare deberet. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 68 | Videmus iam prohdolor unum expletum; det deus, ut secundum nostris temporibus videamus. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |
| 68 | Et quia, ut dixi, ecclesia Romana aut etiam alia, scilicet Constantinopolitana, capitur saepe pro sibi unitis subiectis ecclesiis, et haec unio vocatur apud Graecos synodus, apud nos concilium, restat nunc de concilio aliqua subnectere. | **Quod est in omni parte** - What is in every part |

| 70 | Tamen haec diffinitio forte non est sufficiens, quia potest trahi ad concilium universale sedis apostolicae, de quo infra proximo capitulo. | Nevertheless, this definition is perhaps not sufficient, because it can be extended to a universal council of the apostolic see, about which we will discuss in the next chapter. |
| 70 | In illo enim est proprie de essentia, quod legatus apostolicae sedis ad minus intersit, si plenum et perfectum esse debet, ut 3 di. | For it properly pertains to the essence of a council that a legate of the apostolic see at least be present, if it is to be full and perfect, as in the third decretal. |
| 70 | § Porro, 17 di. | § Furthermore, the 17th decretal. |
| 70 | Regula. | Rule. |
| 70 | Hincmarus vero Remensis in 20 capitulo de hac tractans materia asserit cuiusdam generalis concilii tempore Caroli in Francia de veneratione imaginum celebrati volumine 4 eius libro ita haberi: «Universitas ab uno cognominatur eo, quod uno multotiens verso propagatur. | Hincmar, bishop of Reims, in treating this matter in the 20th chapter, asserts that in the time of Charles, in France, a general council was celebrated concerning the veneration of images, and in the fourth volume of his book, it is stated thus: "The whole is named from one, because it is often propagated by being turned to one." |
| 70 | Nam multitudo &laddunitate&radd vertente in unum collecta universitas efficitur. | For a multitude, by being turned to unity and collected into one, is made a whole. |
| 70 | Et sicut universalis ecclesia catholica dicitur Graece, ita nimirum quidquid ab eius unitate non discessit, catholicum potest nuncupari. | And just as the universal Catholic Church is called universal in Greek, so undoubtedly whatever does not depart from its unity can be called Catholic. |
| 70 | Omnis enim doctrina Christiana vel quaelibet constitutio sive traditio talis esse debet, ut universali conveniat ecclesiae. | For every Christian doctrine or any constitution or tradition ought to be such that it agrees with the universal Church. |
| 70 | Quod nequaquam haeretici servaverunt, qui per diversas mundi partes aliquibus regionum partibus coarctati conventicula quaedam statuerunt, quibus se et plures ab ecclesiastico consortio segregarunt. | Which heretics have by no means observed, who, being confined to certain parts of regions, have established certain conventicles, by which they and many others have segregated themselves from the ecclesiastical community. |
| 70 | Cum ergo duarum aut trium provinciarum episcopi conveniunt et ea statuunt, quae catholicae ecclesiae conveniunt, fortasse universale dici potest, quamvis non sit ab universis mundi praesulibus actum. | Therefore, when the bishops of two or three provinces convene and establish those things which are agreeable to the Catholic Church, it can perhaps be called universal, although it is not acted upon by all the presbters of the world. |
| 70 | Sufficit, quod ab universorum fide et traditionibus non discrepet. | It suffices that it does not depart from the faith and traditions of all. |
| 70 | » Haec ille. | » He says this. |
| 70 | Et ibi de hoc plura. | And there, many things are discussed about this. |
| 71 | Unde diverso respectu universale concilium potest nuncupari patrum conventus: aut quia rem tractant et diffiniunt catholicam ecclesiasticam et veram patres, aut quia de universali ecclesiae statu tractant, aut de universali causa certae integrae et magnae provinciae et oboedientiae. | Whence, a universal council can be called a gathering of fathers in a diverse respect: either because they treat and define a Catholic, ecclesiastical, and true matter, or because they treat of the state of the universal Church, or of a universal cause of a certain, entire, and great province and obedience. |
| 71 | Secundum enim diffinitionem concilii iudicium istud universalitatis fit: &laddNam aut&radd de causa, quae cunctis communis est modo dicto: et tunc recte et communiter universale dicitur, quando per universalem congregationem universalis catholica diffinitio fit. | For according to the definition of a council, this judgment of universality is made: For either it is about a cause which is common to all in the manner said: and then it is rightly and commonly called universal, when a universal definition is made by a universal congregation of the universal Catholic Church. |
| 71 | Aliud autem concilium, licet universale propter causam universalem dicatur, tamen non proprie catholicum universale. | But another council, although it is called universal on account of a universal cause, is nevertheless not properly universal and Catholic. |
| 71 | Unde in Africano concilio, ubi statuitur de hoc ultimo universali concilio, dicitur: «Ne fatigandis fratribus sit anniversaria congregationis necessitas, placuit, ut, quotiens causa communis totius Africae hoc exegerit, tunc universale congregetur. | Whence, in the African council, where it is established about this last universal council, it is said: "Lest there be an annual necessity of congregation to weary brothers, it has pleased that, as often as a common cause of the whole of Africa shall require it, then a universal council be gathered." |
| 71 | Causae autem cum communes non fuerint, in suis provinciis iudicentur. | But when causes are not common, they should be judged in their own provinces. |
| 71 | » Et proprie illa dicuntur universalia, ubi aliqua diffinitio fidei contra haereticos facta fuit, ut probat textus 100 di. | » And properly, those councils are called universal, where some definition of faith has been made against heretics, as the text of the 100th decretal proves. |
| 71 | Optatum, licet omne universale concilium oporteat etiam canones promulgare, 16 di. | It is fitting, although every universal council ought to promulgate canons, as in the 16th decretal. |
| 71 | Habeo. | I have. |
| 71 | Sunt autem synodicae congregationes differentes gradatim a minima per media varia usque ad universalem maximam. | But there are synodical congregations differing gradually from the smallest through various media to the greatest universal. |
| 71 | Nam curatus suae parochiae synodum congregat, et est supra eam dioecesana, supra quam metropolitana, supra quam provincialis regni vel nationis, supra quam patriarchalis, et omnium maxima universalis ecclesiae catholicae. | For a parish priest gathers a synod of his parish, and there is a diocesan synod above it, above which is a metropolitan synod, above which is a provincial synod of a kingdom or nation, above which is a patriarchal synod, and the greatest of all is the universal Catholic Church. |
| 71 | Et ut Leo ad Marcianum scribens in ea epistula, ubi de directa vicis suae legatione pro Calcedonensi concilio scribit, ait: «Tunc nullum censeri debet concilium, quod non innititur veritati fidei, sed conciliabulum verius debet nuncupari. | And as Leo, writing to Marcian, in that letter, where he writes about the direct legation of his vicar for the Chalcedonian council, says: "Then no council ought to be considered, which does not rest on the truth of faith, but it ought to be called rather a conciliabulum." |
| 72 | Capitulum II. | Chapter II. |
| 72 | Habet autem quisque praesidens in suo gradu sibi unitos convocare, sine quo aut eius &laddvices&radd gerente concilium plenum nec rite adunatum censetur. | And each one presiding in his own grade has those united to him, without which, or without his vicar, a council is not considered full or rightly united. |
| 72 | Unde cum Romanus pontifex supremus capitaneus militantis huius ecclesiae et princeps in episcopatu fidei exsistat, universalia concilia sine eo rite eiusve auctoritate regulariter non celebrantur, 96 di. | Whence, when the Roman pontiff is the supreme captain of this militant Church and prince in the episcopate of faith, universal councils are not regularly celebrated without him or his authority, as in the 96th decretal. |
| 72 | Ubi nam, 17 di. | Where, namely, the 17th decretal. |
| 72 | § Hinc etiam et c. | § Hence, also, and c. |
| 72 | Regula et Leo Nonus in epistula ad Carthaginensem Petrum de hoc scribit, ad idem 3 q. | The Rule and Leo the Ninth, in a letter to Peter of Carthage, write about this, to the same 3 q. |
| 72 | 6 Dudum, et variis locis idem habetur, sicut nec sine metropolitano provincialis aut sine patriarcha universalis patriarchalis aut sine episcopo dioecesana. | 6 Dudum, and it is contained in various places, just as a provincial synod cannot be held without a metropolitan, or a universal patriarchal synod without a patriarch, or a diocesan synod without a bishop. |
| 72 | Ratio est manifesta et diffinitiones sacrorum conciliorum in variis passibus hoc ostendunt, 17 di. | The reason is manifest, and the definitions of sacred councils in various passages show this, as in the 17th decretal. |
| 72 | Regula cum capitulis ibi sequentibus, 18 di. | The Rule with the following chapters, as in the 18th decretal. |

| 72 | Si quis et c. | If anyone, and c. |
| 72 | sequente. | following. |
| 72 | Ad universalem enim patriarcham spectat universalis concilii convocatio. | For it pertains to a universal patriarch to convoke a universal council. |
| 72 | Unde Pelagius ad episcopos a Ioanne Constantinopolitano congregatos: «Relatum est ad apostolicam sedem Ioannem Constantinopolitanum episcopum universalem se scribere vosque hac sua praesumptione ad synodum convocare generalem» etc. | Whence, Pelagius to the bishops gathered by John of Constantinople: "It has been reported to the apostolic see that John, bishop of Constantinople, writes to you as universal, and by this presumption of his, summons a general synod," etc. |
| 72 | Ita dicit Marcellus papa et martyr in 5 c. | Thus Marcellus, pope and martyr, says in the 5th chapter. |
| 72 | decretorum suorum: «Apostoli eorumque successores domino inspirante constituerunt, ut nulla fieret synodus praeter Romanae sedis auctoritatem. | of his decrees: "The apostles and their successors, by the inspiration of the Lord, have constituted that no synod be held except by the authority of the Roman see." |
| 72 | Nam illius sedis episcopus iudex est totius ecclesiae, nec aliquod iudicium valet absque legitimo iudice. | For the bishop of that see is the judge of the whole Church, and no judgment is valid without a legitimate judge. |
| 72 | » Hoc etiam affirmat Damasus papa c. | » This also Damasus, pope, affirms in c. |
| 72 | 9 decretorum suorum. | 9 of his decrees. |
| 72 | Similiter Anastasius et Iulius Romani pontifices. | Similarly, Anastasius and Julius, Roman pontiffs. |
| 73 | Hinc non est opus multum superfluo insistere. | Hence, it is not necessary to insist much on this. |
| 73 | Unde licet universalia concilia saepe legamus convocata per imperatores, immo omnia octo, ut ex gestis haberi potest, usque ad octavum tempore Basilii imperatoris Constantinopoli convocatum, 15 di. | Whence, although we often read that universal councils were convoked by emperors, indeed all eight, as can be gathered from the acts, up to the eighth convoked at Constantinople in the time of Emperor Basil, as in the 15th decretal. |
| 73 | c. | c. |
| 73 | 1, tamen in conciliis fuit semper praesidentialis Romani pontificis auctoritas, sine qua universale concilium non fuisset, dummodo saltem interesse voluisset et potuisset. | 1, nevertheless, the presidential authority of the Roman pontiff has always been in councils, without which a universal council would not have been, provided that at least he wished and was able to be present. |
| 73 | Unde sicut perfecta provincialis synodus sine metropolita non est, ut scribitur paenultima actione Calcedonensis concilii et communis omnium antiquorum sententia, ita in proposito de universali: papa, dummodo saltem velit et possit. | Whence, just as a provincial synod is not perfect without a metropolitan, as it is written in the penultimate action of the Chalcedonian council, and the common opinion of all the ancients, so in the proposition about a universal council, the pope, provided that at least he wishes and is able. |
| 73 | Alias, si exspectatus non mitteret vel non veniret vel nollet, concilium congregatum suae necessitati et ecclesiae saluti providere debet. | Otherwise, if, being expected, he does not send or does not come or does not wish, the council gathered ought to provide for its own necessity and the salvation of the Church. |
| 73 | Hoc probat bene textus octavi universalis concilii qui intitulatur: «Diffinitio concilii ante adventum vicariorum senioris Romae, ubi post plura, quomodo iam dudum exspectati fuerint vicarii senioris Romae et amplius exspectare non sit iustum, subiungitur: Incongruum omnino putamus despicere fluctuantem Christi et salvatoris nostri ecclesiam per dilationem dispositionis, quae illi debetur. | This is well proved by the text of the eighth universal council, which is entitled: "The definition of the council before the arrival of the vicars of the senior of Rome, where, after many things, it is stated how the vicars of the senior of Rome had long been expected, and it is not just to expect further, it is subjoined: We think it entirely unfitting to despise the fluctuating Church of Christ and our Savior by delaying the disposition which is owed to it." |
| 73 | Hinc ergo velut ex necessitate denuntiamus» etc. | Hence, therefore, we denounce it as a necessity, etc. |
| 73 | Ad idem legitur in gestis secundae Ephesinae synodi, quando concilium misit ad Iulium episcopum, Hilarium diaconum et Dulcitium notarium, ambasiatores Leonis papae, notificando eis, quomodo in postcrastino die concilium sedere vellet, rogando, ut venire maturarent, et ipsi non venerunt, tunc Thalassius, episcopus Caesareae Cappadociae primae, dixit: «Remorare nos in hac civitate multam laesionem omnibus religiosissimis et sanctissimis episcopis et sanctis ecclesiis affert, et non hoc solum, sed et piissimus et amicus Christi imperator accelerari vult synodi finem, ut cum omni subtilitate ea, quae decernentur, agnoscat. | To the same effect, it is read in the acts of the second Ephesine synod, when the council sent to Julius, bishop, Hilary, deacon, and Dulcitius, notary, ambassadors of Pope Leo, notifying them how the council wished to sit on the next day, and asking them to hasten to come, and they not having come, then Thalassius, bishop of Caesarea of Cappadocia, said: "To tarry in this city brings much harm to all the most religious and most holy bishops and holy churches, and not only this, but also the most pious and friend of Christ, the emperor, wishes the end of the synod to be hastened, that he may know with all subtlety those things which are decreed." |
| 73 | Quia igitur, quod decuit et convenit sanctae synodo, hoc factum est, commoniti sunt per eos, qui directi sunt, hii, qui locum tenent sanctissimi et deo amicissimi Leonis archiepiscopi, et refutaverunt convenire nobiscum, arbitror non esse necessariam dilationem, sed si placet sanctae synodo, non ultra ea, quae ad moras pertinent, producantur. | Therefore, since what was fitting and convenient for the holy synod has been done, those who hold the place of the most holy and God-loving Leo, archbishop, have been admonished through those who were sent, and they have refused to come together with us, I judge that there is no need for delay, but if it pleases the holy synod, let not those things which pertain to delays be prolonged further." |
| 73 | » Haec ibi. | » These things are said there. |
| 74 | Ecce, dixit, quod ea, quae ad synodum pertinent, scilicet monitio, ad processum sufficit, maxime ubi venire refutaverint. | Behold, he said, that those things which pertain to a synod, namely, admonition, suffice for the process, especially where they have refused to come. |
| 74 | Tamen, ut praefatus octavi concilii textus probat, nihil praecipitanter fieri debet, sed longo tempore auctoritas Romani pontificis exspectari, sicut ibi anno uno exspectabatur et plus. | Nevertheless, as the aforesaid text of the eighth council proves, nothing ought to be done precipitously, but the authority of the Roman pontiff ought to be long expected, as there a year and more. |
| 74 | Et in hiis, quae ad fidem spectant, sine deliberatione, de qua constet Romanae ecclesiae, etiam in concilio rite congregato, licet absens adhuc sit auctoritas apostolicae sedis, procedendum non est. | And in those things which pertain to faith, without deliberation, of which it is certain to the Roman Church, even in a council rightly gathered, although the authority of the apostolic see is still absent, it is not to be proceeded with. |
| 75 | Capitulum III. | Chapter III. |
| 75 | Et quod ex quinque patriarchalibus sedibus plenum universale concilium colligitur, gesta octavi concilii clare docent. | And the acts of the eighth council clearly demonstrate that a full universal council is gathered from the five patriarchal sees. |
| 75 | Dicitur enim in termino illius concilii, quomodo Basilius imperator «per supremum auxilium et gratiam» quinque patriarchas «ecclesiastici tabernaculi architectos a finibus orbis terrarum» convocavit. | For it is said in the terms of that council how Emperor Basil, "through supreme aid and grace," summoned the five patriarchs, "architects of the ecclesiastical tabernacle from the ends of the earth." |
| 75 | Et plura ibi de hoc. | And there is more on this. |
| 75 | Qui textus infra in tertia parte habetur. | This text is found below in the third part. |
| 75 | Et actione nona eiusdem concilii legitur synodum in receptione vicarii throni Alexandriae dixisse, qui ultimo venit: «Glorificamus deum universorum, qui, quod deerat universali synodo, supplevit et eam nunc perfectissimam demonstravit» etc. | And in the ninth action of the same council, the synod is read as having said in receiving the vicar of the throne of Alexandria, who came last: "We glorify the God of all, who, what was lacking to the universal synod, has supplied and now shown it to be most perfect," etc. |
| 75 | Ex quo habetur perfectissimam synodum de capitibus totius ecclesiae colligi. | From which it is evident that a most perfect synod is gathered on the heads of the whole Church. |
| 75 | Unde in convocatione vim concilii non puto ponendam, dummodo saltem patres sint, qui universalem ecclesiam repraesentent. | Therefore, I do not believe that the force of the council should be placed in the convocation, provided that there are at least fathers who represent the universal Church. |
| 75 | Sed si nec patres, qui capita ecclesiarum sunt, ibi exsistunt nec convocatio legitima supremae potestatis, non dubium in eo concilio universalis ecclesiae repraesentationem esse non posse. | But if neither the fathers, who are the heads of the churches, are present there, nor a legitimate convocation of supreme authority, there is no doubt that the representation of the universal Church cannot be in that council. |
| 75 | Ubi autem legitima praecessit convocatio nec adhuc patres qui capita exsistunt, convenerunt, non crederem subito currendum esse, quia multa concilia etiam rite convocata errasse legimus, sed exspectandi sunt patres, licet non omnes necessario exspectentur, quoniam sufficit plures esse et omnes vocatos. | However, where a legitimate convocation has preceded and yet the fathers who are the heads have not yet assembled, I would not believe that one should immediately rush, because we read that many councils, even those rightly convoked, have erred, but the fathers should be awaited, although not all necessarily, since it is sufficient that there are many and that all have been called. |
| 75 | Ita enim legitur sanctum Ambrosium in concilio Aquileiensi Palladio haeretico de fide renuenti propter absentiam orientalium episcoporum respondisse, quia dixit solum in pleno concilio, quale hoc non esset, de fide respondendum, conclusisse: Orientales imperatores convocarunt et sic venire potuerunt, quare haec allegatio est evagar<i>. | For thus Saint Ambrose, in the Aquileian council, is read as having answered Palladius, the heretic, who refused to speak about faith because of the absence of the Eastern bishops, because he said that only in a full council, such as this was not, should one respond about faith, concluding: The Eastern emperors summoned them and thus they could come, therefore this allegation is wandering. |
| 75 | Unde ad hoc, quod regulare sit concilium universale, tunc palam, non clandestine debet celebrari, ut ex quinta actione octavi concilii universalis colligitur. | Therefore, for a council to be universal, it must be celebrated openly, not secretly, as is gathered from the fifth action of the eighth universal council. |
| 76 | Item libertas talis in eo debet esse, ut quisque liberalem loquendi habeat facultatem, ut in sexto concilio generali tempore Agathonis celebrato in prima actione et in fine epistulae synodicae Agathonis legitur. | Also, there should be such freedom in it that everyone should have the freedom of speech, as is read in the sixth general council, celebrated in the time of Agatho, in the first action and at the end of Agatho's synodal letter. |
| 76 | Unde, cum Nicolao papae de concilio Photii numeroso obiectum esset, dixit: «Nos quidem non tantum numerosum episcoporum collegium Nicaeni vel Calcedonensis conciliorum ceterorumque sanctorum patrum synodicas constitutiones sequimur, sed illorum liberales veneramur iustas et divinitus inspiratas sententias. | Therefore, when a numerous assembly of bishops was objected to Pope Nicholas about the council of Photius, he said: "We indeed not only follow the synodal constitutions of the numerous assembly of bishops of the Nicene and Chalcedonian councils and other holy fathers, but we venerate their liberal, just, and divinely inspired opinions." |
| 76 | » Ex quo habetur numerum patrum magnam auctoritatem praestare cum liberalitate loquendi. | From this it is evident that a large number of fathers provides authority with freedom of speech. |
| 76 | Potius enim ei statur, quod a pluribus quam quod a paucioribus dictatur, 19 di. | For it is more important that it is said by many than by few. |
| 76 | In canonicis, 20 di. | In the canons. |
| 76 | De quibus, 2 q. | About which. |
| 76 | 7 Puto; et non est numerus adeo necessarius sicut libertas et unanimitas, 24 q. | I think; and number is not so necessary as freedom and unanimity. |
| 76 | 1 Alienus. | Alien. |
| 76 | Unde Agatho scribens Constantino loco praetacto de patribus in sexto concilio congregandis dicit: «Verbum impunitatis et liberalem loquendi facultatem unicuique loqui volenti pro fide quam credit et tenet concedite, quatenus ab omnibus manifestissime cognoscatur quod nullo terrore, nulla potestate, nulla comminatione vel aversione quisquam pro veritate loqui volens prohibitus aut repulsus exsistat», et iterum: «Oportet quod privatae causae religionis obtentu non exerceantur. | Therefore, Agatho, writing to the prefect of Constantinople about the fathers to be assembled in the sixth council, says: "Grant to everyone who wishes to speak the word of impunity and the freedom of speech for the faith which he believes and holds, so that it may be most clearly known that no one who wishes to speak the truth is prohibited or repelled by any fear, any power, any threat or aversion," and again: "Private causes should not be exercised for the sake of religion." |
| 76 | » Unde Leo papa ad Theodosium imperatorem de errore synodi Ephesinae dicit: «Dum privatae causae religionis exercentur obtentu, commissum est impietate paucorum, quod universam ecclesiam vulneraret. | Therefore, Pope Leo, writing to Emperor Theodosius about the error of the Ephesian synod, says: "While private causes of religion are exercised, the impiety of a few has been committed, which would wound the whole Church." |
| 76 | Comperimus non incerto nuntio convenisse ad synodum plures sacerdotes, quorum utique frequentia consultationi et iudicio profuisset, si is, qui sibi locum principalem vendicabat, sacerdotalem moderationem voluisset custodire, ut, sicut moris est, omnium sententiis ex libertate prolatis id tranquillo et aequo constitueretur ex animo, quod et fidei congrueret et errantibus subveniret. | We have learned, not by uncertain report, that many priests have come to the synod, whose presence would certainly have benefited the consultation and judgment, if he who claimed the principal place had wished to maintain priestly moderation, so that, as is customary, the opinions of all being freely expressed, that which was both congruent with faith and helpful to those in error might be established peacefully and equitably. |
| 76 | In ipso autem iudicio non omnes qui convenerant interfuisse cognovimus. | However, we have learned that not all who had come were present at the judgment. |
| 76 | Nam alios reiectos, alios didicimus intromissos, qui supradicti sacerdotis arbitrio captivas manus impiis subscriptionibus dederunt, quod nociturum statui suo scirent, nisi &laddimperata&radd fecissent, talemque ab eo prolatam esse sententiam, ut, dum unus homo impetitur, in omnem ecclesiam saevire videretur. | For we have learned that some were rejected, others admitted, who, at the will of the aforementioned priest, gave their captive hands to impious subscriptions, knowing that their state would be harmed unless they had done what was commanded, and that such a judgment was pronounced by him, that, while one man is attacked, it seemed to rage against the whole Church. |
| 76 | Quod nostri ab apostolica sede directi adeo impium et catholicae fidei contrarium esse viderunt, ut ad consentiendum nulla potuerint oppressione compelli, constanterque in eadem synodo, ut decuit, fuerunt protestati nequaquam id, quod constituebatur, apostolicam sedem recepturam», et infra: «Omnes nostrarum partium ecclesiae mansuetudinem vestram cum gemitibus et lacrimis supplicant sacerdotes, ut, quia et nostri fideliter reclamarunt et eisdem libellum appellationis dedit Flavianus episcopus, generalem synodum intra Italiam iubeatis celebrari», et infra: «Quam autem post appellationem interpositam hoc necesse postuletur, canonum Nicaeae habitorum decreta testantur, quae a totius mundi sacerdotibus sunt constituta. | Which our representatives from the Apostolic See saw to be so impious and contrary to the Catholic faith that they could not be compelled to consent by any oppression, and they constantly protested in the same synod, as was fitting, that they would not receive what was being established by the Apostolic See, and below: "All the priests of our parts of the Church beseech your gentleness with groans and tears, that, because our faithful have also complained and Flavian, the bishop, has given them a book of appeal, you command a general synod to be celebrated within Italy," and below: "But the decrees of the Nicene canons, established by the priests of the whole world, testify that this is necessary after an appeal has been made." |
| 76 | » Haec ille. | That is what he said. |
| 77 | Ecce nunc essentialia ad universale concilium, ubi universalia tractari debent, quod non secrete, sed publice omnibus liberrima detur audientia, et si tunc concordanti sententia aliquid fuerit diffinitum, per sanctum spiritum censetur inspiratum et per Christum in medio congregatorum eius nomine praesidentem infallibiliter iudicatum. | Behold now the essentials for a universal council, where universal matters should be discussed, that everyone should be given the freest hearing, not secretly, but publicly, and if something is then defined by unanimous agreement, it is considered inspired by the Holy Spirit and infallibly judged by Christ in the midst of those gathered in his name. |
| 77 | Tale fuit Nicaenum concilium, de quo legitur in gestis Calcedonensis concilii quod spiritus sanctus manifeste ibi patribus consedit. | Such was the Nicene council, of which it is read in the acts of the Chalcedonian council that the Holy Spirit sat manifestly there with the fathers. |
| 77 | Et subiungitur spiritum sanctum ea ordinare, quae in huiusmodi conciliis ordinantur, ergo, qui retractat ea, spiritus sancti cassat gratiam. | And it is added that the Holy Spirit ordains what is ordained in such councils, therefore, he who retracts them, casts off the grace of the Holy Spirit. |
| 77 | Sancta synodus dixit: «Omnes hoc dicimus. | The Holy Synod said: "We all say this." |
| 77 | Anathema, qui retractat. | Anathema to him who retracts. |
| 77 | » Talia fuerunt omnia orthodoxa concilia. | Such were all the orthodox councils. |
| 77 | Quare in conclusione octavi concilii, cum causa, cur ei oboediendum sit, exprimitur, dicitur: «Per datam nobis potestatem a sancto spiritu, a primo et magno pontifice nostro», et infra: «Quis enim nesciat, quod in medio sanctae synodi fuerit incomprehensibilis et incircumscriptus Christus et dominus, qui dixit: Ubi duo vel tres fuerint congregati etc.? | Therefore, in the conclusion of the eighth council, when the reason why it should be obeyed is expressed, it is said: "By the power given to us by the Holy Spirit, from our first and great pontiff," and below: "For who does not know that Christ and the Lord, who said, 'Where two or three are gathered together,' etc., was incomprehensible and uncircumscribed in the midst of the Holy Synod?" |
| 77 | » Quod maxima sit universalis concilii potestas, patet ex eo, quod Helpidius, vir spectabilis, ad concilium Calcedonense dixit, ut in prima legitur actione. | That the power of a universal council is greatest is evident from the fact that Helpidius, a notable man, said to the Council of Chalcedon, as is read in the first action. |
| 77 | Dixit enim: «Hodie cunctorum deus, verbum, salvator nobis se ad iudicandum tradidit et patitur iudicantes et honorat potestatem decreti. | For he said: "Today the God of all, the Word, the Savior, has delivered himself to us for judgment and suffers the judges and honors the power of the decree." |
| 77 | » Quale sit autem decretum hoc, ex quo eam habent potestatem patres in concilio, in actione prima et quinta octavi concilii habetur, ubi dicitur: «Sanctissimi vicarii senioris Romae et nos, qui reliquarum sedium vicarii sumus, haec omnia dissolvimus hodie gratia Iesu Christi, qui nobis dedit summi sacerdotii potestatem ligandi atque solvendi» etc. | What this decree is, from which the fathers in the council have this power, is found in the first and fifth actions of the eighth council, where it is said: "The most holy vicars of the senior of Rome and we, who are the vicars of the other sees, dissolve all these today by the grace of Jesus Christ, who gave us the power of the supreme priesthood to bind and loose," etc. |
| 77 | Unde potestas ligandi et solvendi Petro figuram ecclesiae gerenti tradita est. | Therefore, the power of binding and loosing was given to Peter, who bore the figure of the Church. |
| 77 | Hoc decretum, ex quo iudicium synodi suam capit firmitatem. | This decree, from which the judgment of the synod derives its firmness. |
| 77 | Et de hac auctoritate conciliorum Isidorus in principio libri sui, quem de synodis colligit, eleganter scribit, ubi videri potest. | And Isidore writes elegantly about this authority of councils at the beginning of his book, which he gathers on synods, where it can be seen. |
| 78 | Capitulum IV. | Chapter IV. |
| 78 | Verum quia dixi, quod, si ex concordantia procedit diffinitio, tunc ex sancto spiritu processisse creditur, quoniam ipse est auctor pacis ac concordiae, et non est humanum varios homines in unum congregatos in summa libertate loquendi constitutos ex una concordantia iudicare, sed divinum, ideo praesumi hoc omnino debet. | But because I said that, if the definition proceeds from concord, then it is believed to have proceeded from the Holy Spirit, since He is the author of peace and concord, and it is not human but divine for various men gathered together in the highest freedom of speech to judge from one concord, therefore this ought to be entirely presumed. |
| 78 | Ita enim legitur in quinta actione octavi concilii, ubi, dum de sententia concilii dicitur, eam asserunt patres divina inspiratione depromptam, quia unanimitate et concordia sanctae synodi fuit promulgata. | For thus it is read in the fifth session of the eighth council, where, while the judgment of the council is discussed, the fathers assert that it was drawn forth by divine inspiration, because it was promulgated by the unanimity and concord of the holy synod. |
| 78 | Et post terminum octavi universalis Constantinopolitani Basilius imperator ad synodum dixit: «Dicat nunc sancta et universalis synodus, si omnibus sanctissimis episcopis concordantibus atque consentientibus praesens terminus sit depromptus. | And after the conclusion of the eighth universal council at Constantinople, Emperor Basil said to the synod: "Let the holy and universal synod now declare whether the present conclusion was drawn forth with the agreement and consent of all the most holy bishops." |
| 78 | Oportet enim divina quaeque cum universorum consensu et concordantia in ecclesiasticis praedicari et confirmari collegiis. | For it is necessary that all divine things be preached and confirmed in ecclesiastical assemblies with the consensus and concord of all. |
| 78 | » Sancta synodus dixit: «Omnes ita sapimus. | The holy synod said: "We all think thus. |
| 78 | Omnes ita praedicamus. | We all preach thus. |
| 78 | Omnes concinentes et consentientes prompte subscribimus. | We all, agreeing and consenting, readily subscribe. |
| 78 | Hoc est veritatis iudicium. | This is the judgment of truth. |
| 78 | Hoc est iustitiae decretum. | This is the decree of justice." |
| 78 | » Et ibi de hoc plura. | And there is more on this matter. |
| 79 | Ecce concordantiam maxime in hiis quae fidei sunt, requiri, et de quanto maior concordantia, de tanto infallibilius iudicium. | Behold, concord is especially required in matters of faith, and the greater the concord, the more infallible the judgment. |
| 79 | Unde, ut in Calcedonensi concilio legitur, maior pars semper regulariter vincat et hoc iudicium certius praesumatur. | Hence, as is read in the Council of Chalcedon, the greater part always regularly prevails, and this judgment is more certainly presumed. |
| 79 | Tamen ex sententia praefata in fidei materia non est tutum iudicium, nisi maxima multitudo fuerit sacerdotum coadunata. | Yet, according to the aforementioned opinion, in matters of faith, judgment is not safe unless the greatest multitude of priests has been gathered. |
| 79 | Tunc enim iuxta sententiam sancti Cypriani, cum maior pars semper ex decreto Christi absque errore permanebit, maioris partis sententia multum haberet praesumptionis, sic quod, &laddsi&radd aliqua stabilitas absque immutatione illius sententiae in ipsis permaneret, fortius esset praesumptionis iudicium. | For then, according to the opinion of St. Cyprian, since the greater part will always remain without error by the decree of Christ, the judgment of the greater part would have much presumption, so that if any stability remained without change of that judgment in them, the judgment of presumption would be stronger. |
| 79 | Veritas enim permanet in saeculum saeculi, et falsitas se ipsam aliquamdiu conservare nequit. | For truth remains forever, and falsehood cannot preserve itself for long. |
| 80 | Unde licet in synodis universalibus plura necessaria sint, maxime tamen, ut praehabitum est, communis omnium sententia. | Hence, although many things are necessary in universal councils, yet, as previously stated, the common opinion of all is most important. |
| 80 | Unde Leo papa ad synodum Ephesinam dicit: «Pie ac religiose christianissimus imperator habere voluit concilium episcopale, ut pleniori iudicio omnis possit error aboleri. | Hence Pope Leo says to the Synod of Ephesus: "The most Christian emperor piously and religiously wished to hold an episcopal council, so that by a fuller judgment every error might be abolished. |
| 80 | Fratres nostros Iulium episcopum, Renatum presbyterum et filium meum Hilarium diaconum cumque hiis Dulcitium notarium probatae fidei misi, qui vice mea sancto conventui vestrae fraternitatis intersint et communi vobiscum sententia, quae sint domino placitura, constituant. | I have sent our brothers Bishop Julius, Presbyter Renatus, and my son Deacon Hilarius, along with Dulcitius, a notary of proven faith, who in my place may attend the holy assembly of your fraternity and with you establish by common opinion what may be pleasing to the Lord." |
| 80 | » Haec ibi. | These things are there. |
| 80 | Ecce communi sententia etiam legatorum cum aliis negotia sacri concilii universalis diffiniri debere. | Behold, the affairs of the sacred universal council should also be defined by the common opinion of the legates with others. |
| 81 | Debet etiam sacrum concilium universale regulis sancti spiritus iam in canone sacrae scripturae ac praeteritis conciliis apertis dirigi maxime in negotio fidei, quae una et invariabilis necessario, sicut fuit, permanebit, et scripturas rimare in dubiis, sicut in sexto universali concilio actum fuit et aliis multis, et tunc diffinitio ex allegatis sumpta absque errore necessario erit. | The sacred universal council should also be guided by the rules of the Holy Spirit already in the canon of sacred scripture and in the past councils, especially in the matter of faith, which necessarily remains one and unchangeable, as it was, and to examine the scriptures in doubtful matters, as was done in the sixth universal council and many others, and then the definition drawn from the cited sources will necessarily be without error. |
| 81 | Unde si ea non servantur maxime libera omnium audientia, ac ubi aliqua attentarentur in synodis, quae obviarent fidei Romanae ecclesiae, protestatio iuste ac simul et appellatio ad aliud futurum concilium fieri potest, ut &laddhoc&radd superius est manifestatum. | Hence, if these are not observed, especially the free hearing of all, and if anything is attempted in synods that opposes the faith of the Roman Church, a protest and also an appeal to another future council can justly be made, as was shown above. |
| 81 | Et in epistula Leonis papae et synodi, quae in Roma convenit, ad Pulcheriam Augustam clarius &laddhoc&radd comprobatur, ubi dicitur legatos apostolicae sedis in Ephesina synodo propter vim et metum de nullitate protestatos fuisse et ab ea fide nulla iniuria separari velle, quam a sede Petri apostoli ad sanctam synodum detulissent. | And in the letter of Pope Leo and the synod that convened in Rome to Pulcheria Augusta, this is more clearly proven, where it is said that the legates of the apostolic see in the Synod of Ephesus protested against the nullity due to force and fear and wished to be separated from no injury to the faith, which they had brought from the see of Peter the apostle to the holy synod. |
| 81 | Ex hoc etiam elici potest fidem Romanae ecclesiae in nulla synodo universali retractari posse, hoc verum de fide illius totius ecclesiae per suam synodum, sui scilicet patriarchatus, dictata, ut hoc infra aperietur. | From this it can also be inferred that the faith of the Roman Church cannot be retracted in any universal council, this is true of the faith of that whole church dictated through its synod, namely its patriarchate, as will be shown below. |
| 82 | Capitulum V. | Chapter V. |
| 82 | Hiis consideratis si ad varia gesta conciliabulorum animum applicaverimus, inveniemus, quomodo neutrum in hiis fundamentis fuit vere fundatum, nam aut fuerunt secreta aut humana industria fabricata aut coacta timore. | Considering these things, if we apply our mind to the various acts of the councils, we will find how neither was truly founded on these foundations, for they were either secret or fabricated by human industry or compelled by fear. |
| 82 | Unde licet dicatur Ariminense concilium fuisse 330 episcoporum, ut Augustino contra Felicianum De trinitate scribente obiectum fuit, tamen non invenitur rite, palam et libere congregatum et stabile fuisse in concluso. | Hence, although it is said that the Council of Ariminum was of 330 bishops, as was objected to Augustine when writing against Felicianus on the Trinity, yet it is not found to have been duly, openly, and freely gathered and to have been stable in its conclusion. |
| 82 | &laddDe hoc vero, quomodo reversi sunt ad subscriptionem fidei Nicaenae, qui in Arimino fuerunt, Liberius papa et occidentales episcopi ad Eustachium et Cyrillum scribunt in epistula, quae incipit Optabile nobis. | On this matter, how those who were at Ariminum returned to the subscription of the Nicene faith, Pope Liberius and the western bishops write to Eustathius and Cyril in the letter that begins "Optabile nobis." |
| 82 | &radd Unde Ambrosius De patre et filio libro 1 c. | Hence Ambrose in the first book, chapter 8 of "On the Father and the Son": "You have heard, holy emperor, that those who assert such things are rightly condemned. |
| 82 | 8: «Audisti, sancte imperator, qui talia asserunt iure esse dampnatos. | Not by human industry, nor by any composition, did the 318 bishops come to the Council of Nicaea, but so that in their number the Lord Jesus might prove His presence by the sign of His passion and name, when the cross is in 300, Jesus in 18 priests. |
| 82 | Non humana industria, non compositione aliqua 318 episcopi ad concilium venerunt Nicaenum, sed ut in numero eorum per signum suae passionis et nominis dominus Iesus suo se probaret adesse consensu, quando crux in 300, Iesus in 18 est sacerdotibus. | This had the first confession in the Council of Ariminum, and after the Council of Ariminum the second correction; the confession is attested by the letter sent to Emperor Constantius, the correction is confessed by secret councils." |
| 82 | Hoc in Ariminensi concilio habuit prima confessio, et post Ariminense concilium secunda correctio; <confessionem> epistula ad imperatorem Constantium missa testatur, correctionem secreta concilia confitentur. | These things he says. |
| 82 | » Haec ille. | Hence the same Ambrose in letter 77 against Auxentius writes the same, how the robbery of Ariminum was secretly gathered and corrected, and Augustine in the aforementioned place against Felicianus says that the decrees of that council vanished with the same ease with which they were decreed. |
| 82 | Unde idem Ambrosius in epistula 77 contra Auxentium hoc idem scribit, quomodo Ariminense latrocinium fuit secrete collectum et correctum, et Augustinus loco praedicto contra Felicianum dicit ea facilitate evanuisse dictata illius conciliabuli, qua dictata fuere. | And how this was done, he himself states there. |
| 82 | Et quomodo hoc factum sit, ipse ibidem ponit. | And that it was decreed and subscribed by human faction and compulsion of Constantius without freedom, is found in many writings. |
| 82 | Et quod factione humana et coactione Constantii absque libertate ita dictatum et subscriptum fuit, in multis scripturis invenitur. | And although Pope Liberius was then, who, as Augustine writes against Cresconius, subscribed to the Arian sect—although he resisted at first and for this was sent into exile, and there is an elegant disputation of Emperor Constantius and Liberius, but he returned from exile defeated and consented to the error, as St. Jerome writes in the Chronicles—yet he is not found to have attended that council either personally or through vicars. |
| 82 | Et licet Liberius papa tunc fuit, qui, ut scribit Augustinus contra Crescentium, Arianae sectae se subscripsit – licet resisteret in principio et propter hoc in exsilium missus esset, et habetur elegans disputatio Constantii imperatoris et Liberii, rediit autem de exsilio victus et consensit errori, ut scribit sanctus Hieronymus in Chronicis –, tamen non reperitur concilio illo per se vel vicarios interfuisse. | Hence Pope Damasus and the other bishops gathered in Rome to the most beloved brothers in Illyricum: "For no prejudice could be made by the number gathered at Ariminum, when it is clear that neither the Roman bishop, whose decree they ought to have awaited before all, nor Vincent, who for so many years inviolably guarded the episcopate, nor others gave consent to such things, especially since these, as we have said, who seemed to decline by convention, themselves again using better counsel testified that these things displeased them." |
| 82 | Unde Damasus papa et ceteri episcopi in Roma congregati dilectissimis fratribus in Illyrico constitutis: «Neque enim praeiudicium fieri potuit per numerum Arimino congregatum, quando constat neque Romanum episcopum, cuius ante omnia debebat eos exspectare decretum, neque Vincentium, qui tantis annis episcopatum inviolabiliter custodivit, neque alios talibus praebuisse consensum, maxime dum isti, sicut praediximus, ipsi, qui per conventionem declinasse videbantur, ipsi denuo utentes meliori consilio haec sibi displicere testati sunt. | These things are there. |
| 82 | » Haec ibi. | Hence that council had many defects. |
| 82 | Unde multos defectus habuit illud conciliabulum. | Similarly, the same is clear concerning the second Synod of Ephesus, because, although it was duly gathered by the presence of the vicars of Pope Leo, yet it lacked freedom and, without concord, an erroneous decision was made despite the protests and appeals of the apostolic vicars, as is clearly written in the acts of the Council of Chalcedon, since the fathers who subscribed confessed that they did so out of fear for their bodies, as Pope Leo also writes to Emperor Theodosius and Pulcheria Augusta. |
| 82 | Similiter de Epheisna secunda synodo hoc idem patet, quia, etsi rite congregata fuit per praesentiam vicariorum Leonis papae, tamen defecit libertas et absque concordantia reclamantibus et appellantibus vicariis apostolicis capta fuit erronea decisio, ut in gestis Calcedonensis consilii manifeste scribitur, quoniam, qui se subscripserunt patres, fatebantur metu corporis hoc fecisse, ut de hoc etiam Leo papa ad Theodosium imperatorem et Pulcheriam Augustam scribit. | That the legates of the apostolic see and others who attended the council of Photius did not have freedom, is found in the acts of the eighth universal council. |
| 82 | Quod etiam legati apostolicae sedis ac alii, qui concilio Photii interfuerunt, non potiti sunt libertate, ex gestis octavi concilii universalis habetur. | A similar thing is found in 16 q. 6 Sane. |
| 82 | Simile habetur 16 q. | A similar point is found in 16 q. |
| 82 | 6 Sane. | 6 Indeed. |
| 83 | Quod autem particularia concilia unius episcopi vel provinciae correctionem capiant ab universali, Augustinus scribit, et habetur 2 q. | However, particular councils of one bishop or province, taking correction from the universal, are written by Augustine, and it is held in 2 q. |
| 83 | 7 Puto § Item: Cum Petrus. | 7 I think § Also: When Peter. |
| 83 | Unde etiam de concilio 86 episcoporum, in quo sanctus fuit Cyprianus, de quo Augustinus ad Vincentium Rogatistam et libro 2 contra Donatistas, postea per universale fuit correctum. | From which also the council of 86 bishops is known, in which Saint Cyprian was present, of which Augustine wrote to Vincentius Rogatistus and book 2 against the Donatists, which was later corrected by the universal council. |
| 83 | Dicit enim Augustinus libro 1 Contra Donatistas volens stabili fundamento ex decisione universalis concilii fidem probare: «Iam ne videar humanis argumentis id agere, quoniam quaestionis huius obscuritas prioribus ecclesiae temporibus ante scisma Donati magnos viros et magna caritate praeditos episcopos ita inter se salva pace compulit disceptare atque fluctuare, ut diu conciliorum in suis quibusque regionibus diversa statuta mutaverint, donec plenario totius orbis concilio, quod salubrius sentiebatur, etiam remotis dubitationibus firmaretur. | For Augustine says in book 1 Against the Donatists, wanting to establish a firm foundation from the decision of the universal council, to prove the faith: "Already, lest I seem to be acting on human arguments, since the obscurity of this question compelled great men and men endowed with great charity, bishops in their own times before the schism of Donatus, to dispute and fluctuate in peace, so that they changed various statutes in their respective councils, until a plenary council of the whole world, which was considered more salubrious, was established, and the doubts were removed." |
| 83 | » Et idem, quomodo particularia per plenaria et etiam plenaria per subsequentia plenaria ob facti errorem corrigantur, De unico baptismo libro 1: «Quis nesciat concilia, quae per singulas regiones vel provincias fiunt, plenariorum conciliorum auctoritati, quae fiunt ex universo orbe Christiano, sine ullis ambiguitatibus cedere, ipsa plenaria concilia priora a posterioribus emendari, cum aliquo experimento rerum aperitur, quod clausum erat, et cognoscitur, quod latebat? | "And the same, how particular councils are corrected by plenary ones and also plenary ones by subsequent plenary ones due to the error of fact, in book 1 of On the Single Baptism: "Who does not know that councils held in individual regions or provinces yield to the authority of plenary councils, which are held from the entire Christian world, without any ambiguity, that prior plenary councils are corrected by subsequent ones, when some experience of things is revealed, which was previously closed, and it is known what was hidden?" |
| 83 | » Haec ille. | "This is what he said." |
| 84 | Ex quo duo nota: quod plenarium concilium est totius universae ecclesiae. | From which two points are noted: that the plenary council is the whole of the universal church. |
| 84 | Ita intelligitur ille § Item: Cum Petrus, scilicet quod plenarium concilium vincit omnem auctoritatem. | Thus, it is understood in that § Also: When Peter, namely that the plenary council prevails over all authority. |
| 84 | Similiter est notandum experimento rerum universale plenarium posse deficere. | Similarly, it should be noted that the universal plenary council can err by experience. |
| 84 | Quomodo etiam varia talia fuerunt concilia, quae iudicando errarunt, apud Augustinum in epistula ad Elusium et Glorium et ad ceteros de Donati parte missa et aliis locis invenitur. | How also various councils, which erred in judgment, are found in Augustine's letter to Elusius and Glorius and to others sent from the part of Donatus and in other places. |
| 84 | Unde in hiis omnibus est sententia Ambrosii vera, quod secretiora ab universalibus correctionem recipiunt, iuxta doctrinam Augustini De Christiana doctrina libro 2 c. | From which in all these points the opinion of Ambrose is true, that secret councils receive correction from universals, according to the doctrine of Augustine in book 2 of On Christian Doctrine, chapter 8, that what is universally accepted should be preferred to particular ones. |
| 84 | 8, quod illa quae universaliter recipiuntur, praeponi debent particularibus. | 8. |
| 84 | Vides modo, quanta universalibus conciliis auctoritas inest, dum recte celebrantur. | You see now, how much authority there is in universal councils, when they are celebrated correctly. |
| 84 | Unde Augustinus in sermone contra Pelagianos primae partis dicit matris ecclesiae hanc esse auctoritatem, quod eius fundatissimae veritatis canon talis est, quod quisquis contra hunc inexpugnabilem murum arietat, ipse confringitur. | From which Augustine says in the first part of the sermon against the Pelagians: "This is the authority of the mother church, that its most solid truth is such that whoever attacks this impregnable wall is shattered." |
| 84 | De hoc etiam Contra Faustum libro 11 ait idem Augustinus, et plura de hoc applicari possent scripta, sed hoc loco opus non est. | The same Augustine says in book 11 Against Faustus, and many other writings could be applied to this, but it is not necessary here. |
| 85 | Capitulum VI. | Chapter VI. |
| 85 | In summa est hoc animadvertendum, secundum quod ex conciliorum gestis colligitur quod universalia concilia de consensu Romani pontificis ac aliorum patriarcharum per imperatores super articulis fidei congregabantur. | In summary, it should be noted, as is gathered from the acts of the councils, that universal councils were convened by the consent of the Roman pontiff and other patriarchs by the emperors on articles of faith. |
| 85 | Et in loco congregationis in medio ponebantur sacra evangelia, lignum sanctae crucis aut aliae reliquiae. | And in the place of the assembly, the sacred Gospels were placed in the middle, or the wood of the holy cross, or other relics. |
| 85 | Et omnes catholici episcopi ac abbates intromittebantur una cum illis laicis, quos ipsi vicarii sedium adducebant aut quos ipse imperator loco sui aut secum adesse volebat. | And all the Catholic bishops and abbots entered together with those laymen whom they themselves brought as vicars of the sees or whom the emperor himself wanted to be present in his place or with him. |
| 85 | Et per actiones distinctas secundum dies res tractabantur et per sessiones expediebantur, et in scriptis legebatur cuiusque propositio in alto pulpito. | And the matters were treated in distinct actions according to the days, and they were expedited in sessions, and each proposal was read in the high pulpit from the writings. |
| 85 | Materia vero fidei prius tractabatur, et audiebat synodus utriusque partis allegationes, vidit originalia et principia librorum et totius allegati capituli tenorem, ne syncopate allegatus sensus corrupte adductus forte foret, et cuncta ista mature, palam et publice cum recognitione et librorum et allegationum perficiebantur, et secundum testimonia scripturarum decrevit synodus. | The matter of faith was treated first, and the synod heard the allegations of both parties, saw the originals and principles of the books, and the entire tenor of the alleged chapter, lest the alleged sense be corrupted by syncopation, and all these were perfected, publicly and openly, with recognition of the books and allegations, and the synod decreed according to the testimonies of the scriptures. |
| 85 | Post haec de pace ac reductione lapsorum, compositione litigantium de partium consensu, et ultimo iudicialiter praemisso partium in synodis compromisso de causis se intromittebat, ut reclamatio minus locum sibi vendicaret. | After this, the synod intervened in the peace and reduction of the fallen, in the composition of the litigants, according to the consensus of the parties, and finally, a judicial compromise was made between the parties in the synods, so that the complaint would not gain a place for itself. |
| 85 | Et in qualibet actione in fine surrexit notarius, qui dixit laudes imperatori per multa adiectiva, comparando ipsum aut Constantino aut Marciano, extollendo mores et studium religiositatis eius. | And in each action, at the end, a notary arose, who said laudes to the emperor with many adjectives, comparing him to Constantine or Marcian, extolling his morals and his zeal for religiosity. |
| 85 | Laudes etiam quinque patriarchis dixit et senatui et synodo aeternam memoriam. | Laudes were also said to the five patriarchs and to the senate and synod, with eternal memory. |
| 86 | Statuta vero simul et semel in fine et ante conclusionem publicabantur in duabus partibus synodi, inferiori et superiori, in alta voce per episcopos aut metropolitas. | The statutes were publicly announced at the end and before the conclusion, in two parts of the synod, the lower and the upper, in a loud voice by the bishops or metropolitans. |
| 86 | Subsequebatur conclusio de omnibus gestis concorditer, in qua causa convocationis et capta summaria conclusio inserebatur una cum professione fidei, et laici et principes nihil diffinitive dixerunt, sed sollicitando et exhortando et dirigendo interfuere. | The conclusion of all the acts was followed, in which the cause of the convocation and the summary conclusion were inserted, together with the profession of faith, and the laity and the princes said nothing definitive, but they intervened solicitously and exhortingly and directing. |
| 86 | Ultimo subscriptio adiciebatur, quae varia quoad ordinem invenitur, sicut et sessionis ordo in aliis et aliis conciliis. | Finally, a subscription was added, which varies in order, just as the order of the session in other councils. |
| 86 | Post vicarios patriarchalium sedium subscripserunt se in octava synodo imperatores Basilius et Constantinus, deinde episcopi alii, ac insuper senatus profitebatur se acceptare synodum, et hoc fuit per notarios annotatum. | After the vicars of the patriarchal sees subscribed themselves in the eighth synod, the emperors Basil and Constantine, then the bishops, and the senate also professed to accept the synod, and this was noted by the notaries. |
| 86 | Et plura de hoc applicari possunt scripta, sed hoc loco opus non est. | And many other writings could be applied to this, but it is not necessary here. |
| 86 | Ideo ad alia tendamus. | Therefore, let us proceed to other things. |
| 86 | Post haec de conciliis generalibus quae saepe universalia dicuntur videndum, in quo deceptio multorum modernorum aperitur. | After this, concerning the general councils, which are often called universal, it should be seen, in which deception of many moderns is revealed. |
| 87 | Capitulum VII. | Chapter VII. |
| 87 | Invenitur praeterea universale concilium etiam alicuius magnae provinciae aut duarum simul unitarum saepe vocari, ut in Toletano quodam et certo etiam Africano concilio, de quo supra legitur. | It is also found that the universal council is often called the council of a great province or of two united provinces, as in the Toledo council and the certain African council, of which it is read above. |
| 87 | Invenitur etiam occidentalis ecclesiae concilium universale nuncupari, ut in gestis concilii Aquilegiensis sanctus Ambrosius obicienti haeretico universale concilium non esse respondit. | It is also found that the western church council is called universal, as in the acts of the Aquileian council, where Saint Ambrose, opposing the heretic, replied that the universal council is not. |
| 87 | Unde licet omnia concilia praeter universalis ecclesiae dicantur provincialia, ut 3 di. | Wherefore, although all councils are called provincial except the universal church, as in 3 di. |
| 87 | Regula vel § Porro, etiam cum legato apostolicae sedis celebrata, ut ibidem, &laddet cum patriarcha, ut in ultima actione Calcedonensis concilii probatur, ubi Athanasius in concilio Antiocheni patriarchae, quia ter vocatus non venit, legitur in provinciali concilio depositus&radd. | Rule or § Moreover, even when celebrated with the apostolic see's legate, as in ibidem, and with the patriarch, as in the last action of the Calcedonian council, it is proved that Athanasius was deposed in the provincial council because he was called three times and did not come. |
| 87 | Et omnia concilia vocantur localia praeter universalis ecclesiae concilia, de quo vide textum I q. | And all councils are called local except the universal church councils, of which see the text I q. 7. |
| 87 | 7 Convenientibus, qui est secundi Nicaeni concilii et dicit septem tantum universalia concilia praecessisse, alia localia fuisse. | Convenientibus, who is the second Nicaean council, and says that seven universal councils preceded, the others were local. |
| 87 | Et quamquam glossa dicat ideo illa generalia fuisse, quia apostolicae sedis legati interfuerunt, tamen, etiam si hoc argumentum esset bonum: absque auctoritate sedis apostolicae concilium universale esse non potest, tamen non sequitur: ubi praesidet papa in concilio vel eius legatus, ibi est universale concilium &ladduniversalis ecclesiae. | And although the gloss says that they were general because the apostolic see's legates were present, yet, even if this argument were good: without the authority of the apostolic see, a council cannot be universal, it does not follow: where the pope presides in the council or his legate, there is a universal council &ladduniversal church. |
| 87 | Sextum enim Carthaginense, in quo interfuerunt legati Zosimi papae, Faustinus episcopus, Philippus et Asellus presbyteri, et quoddam Arelatense, in quo interfuere secundum aliquos Theodorus episcopus ex Dalmatia et Agathon diaconus legati Silvestri papae, et consimilia concilia provincialia dicuntur&radd. | For the sixth Carthaginian, in which the legates of Pope Zosimus, Faustinus the bishop, Philip and Asellus the priests, and a certain Arelatense, in which the legates of Pope Silvester, Theodore the bishop from Dalmatia and Agathon the deacon, intervened, and similar councils are called provincial &radd. |
| 87 | Unde Leo papa ad Theodosium Augustum: «Concilium universale intra Italiam, sicut synodus, quae ob hanc causam Romae convenerat, mecum petit, clementia vestra concedat. | Wherefore, Pope Leo to Emperor Theodosius Augustus: "The council, which is called universal within Italy, like the synod, which convened in Rome for this reason, I ask your clemency to grant." |
| 87 | » Haec ibi. | "This is there." |
| 87 | Ecce universalem synodum per synodum, ubi papa praesedit, ab imperatore intra Italiam petitam, quod est notandum. | Behold, the universal synod is asked by the synod, where the pope presided, within Italy, which is to be noted. |
| 87 | Et textus 17 c. | And the text 17 c. of the eighth council, which is placed below, clearly proves this, when it says one universal council, another, in which the pope presided as patriarch. |
| 87 | octavi concilii, qui infra ponitur, manifeste hoc probat, dum aliud dicit universale concilium, aliud, in quo papa ut patriarcha praesedit. | The eighth council, which is set forth below, clearly proves this, since it distinguishes between a universal council and one in which the pope presided as patriarch. |
| 88 | Tamen saepe concilium patriarchale papae universale sive generale dicitur, ut patet in capitulo Antiqua De privilegiis, ubi suprascriptio nominat generale et textus universale, licet frequentius dicatur generale quam universale. | However, the patriarchal council is often called the universal or general council of the pope, as is evident in the chapter "Antiqua De privilegiis," where the superscription names it "general" and the text "universal," although "general" is more frequently used than "universal." |
| 88 | Et similiter, licet concilium universalis ecclesiae proprie universale dicatur et ita frequenter nominetur, tamen aliquando vocatur generale, sicut Leo papa in epistula quae incipit: Omnium de approbatione fidei Calcedonensis concilii nominat illud Calcedonense generale. | Similarly, although the council of the universal Church is properly called universal and is frequently so named, it is sometimes called general, as Pope Leo in the letter beginning "Omnium de approbatione fidei Calcedonensis concilii" names the Council of Chalcedon "general." |
| 88 | Et Gregorius, 50 di. | And Gregory, 50 distinctions. |
| 88 | Quia sanctitas, nominat omnia quinque universalia generalia. | Because his holiness names all five universal councils "general." |
| 88 | De isto autem generali nostro ait Constantinus imperator; ad Agathonem papam scribens pro sexto concilio dicit, ut mittat de sua ecclesia tres personas et suo concilio duodecim metropolitanos. | Regarding this general council of ours, the Emperor Constantine, writing to Pope Agatho concerning the sixth council, says that he should send three persons from his church and twelve metropolitans from his council. |
| 88 | Cui Agatho rescribit, quod iuxta defectum temporis ac servilis provinciae qualitatem pro satisfactione oboedientiae mittit, et nisi longus provinciarum ambitus, in quibus humilitatis suae concilium constitutum est, fecisset, citius convocasset et misisset, uti haec in gestis sexti universalis concilii leguntur. | To whom Agatho replies that, given the shortage of time and the nature of his province, he sends [representatives] in fulfillment of his obedience, and that if the vast extent of the provinces in which his humble council was constituted had not been a factor, he would have summoned and sent [representatives] sooner, as these things are read in the acts of the sixth universal council. |
| 89 | Ex quo habetur papam ut quemlibet patriarcham habere proprium subiectum concilium patriarchale, ut habetur ibidem in prima actione c. | From which it is held that the pope, like any patriarch, has his own subject patriarchal council, as is found there in the first act, chapter Piissimus. |
| 89 | Piissimus. | Most pious. |
| 89 | Et sunt septentrionales et occidentales de illo concilio, prout ibidem habetur magis particulariter. | And they are from the north and west of that council, as is found there more particularly. |
| 89 | Per Agathonem enim et suam synodum ad Constantinum scribitur sic: «Constantino, magno imperatori, Heraclio et Tiberio augustis Agatho episcopus, servus servorum dei, cum universis synodis subiacentibus concilio apostolicae sedis. | For Agatho and his synod write to Constantine thus: "To Constantine, great emperor, Heraclius and Tiberius Augustus, Agatho, bishop, servant of the servants of God, with all the synods subject to the council of the apostolic see." |
| 89 | Omnium bonorum spes inesse dignoscitur, dum imperiale fastigium eius, a quo se coronatum et hominibus praestitutum ad salubriter gubernandum agnoscit, veram de eo confessionem, qua sola prae omnibus muneribus delectatur, inquirit fideliter et vivaciter amplecti desiderat. | All good hope is recognized to be present, while his imperial dignity, by which he acknowledges himself crowned and appointed by men to govern salutarily, faithfully and eagerly desires to embrace the true confession concerning him, in which alone he delights above all gifts. |
| 89 | Et hoc deo praestantissimum munus est, a quo procedit omne quod bonum est, ad quem redigitur, quod de eius maiestate perceptum est, cuius spiritu perstruente in mentis arcanis et convalescente spiritali flagrantia piae intentionis radii circumquaque perlustrant et suavitatis odor de sacrificio cordis ascendit ad dominum, qui tali munere complacatur. | And this is the most excellent gift from God, from whom proceeds all that is good, to whom is reduced what has been perceived of his majesty, whose spirit, building up in the secrets of the mind and strengthening the spiritual fervor of pious intention, explores all around with rays, and the sweet odor of the sacrifice of the heart ascends to the Lord, who is pleased with such a gift. |
| 89 | Unde in terrestribus felicitatem donet et gentes subiuget universas, quas ad verae suae cognitionis confessionem asciscat, quas subiectas Christiano imperio de potestate liberet tenebrarum, ut felices faciat humiliatos, quos infeliciter exaltari ad eorum deiectionem permiserat. | Whence he grants happiness in earthly things and subdues all nations, which he admits to the confession of his true knowledge, which he frees from the power of darkness, subject to the Christian empire, so that he makes the humble happy, whom he had allowed to be unhappily exalted to their downfall. |
| 89 | Quia vero, piissime atque fortissime principum auguste, vestrae pietatis cum laude admiramur deo dignum propositum, quomodo circa apostolicam nostram fidem habere dignamini deo secretius satisfaciente non verbis fluentibus nec loquacitate fallaci, sed divina sua gratia commovente omnique ambiguitate sublata desideratis cognoscere, quae veritas orthodoxae atque apostolicae fidei contineat, omnes nos exigui ecclesiarum praesules vestri Christiani imperii famuli in septentrionalibus et occiduis partibus constituti, licet parvi ac simplices scientia, fide tamen per dei gratiam stabiles pro hiis, quae per divalem sacram praeceptam cognovimus conregnante ac dispensante vobiscum conditore et dispensatore omnium deo exhilarati pro huiusmodi pio proposito cum intimis cordis fletibus gratias reddere cepimus. | Because, most pious and strongest of august princes, we admire with praise of your piety the purpose worthy of God, how you deign to satisfy God more secretly concerning our apostolic faith, not with flowing words nor with deceitful eloquence, but moved by his divine grace and with all ambiguity removed, you desire to know what truth the orthodox and apostolic faith contains, all of us, the small prelates of the churches, your servants of the Christian empire, constituted in the northern and western parts, although small and simple in knowledge, yet firm in faith through God's grace, for these things which we have known through divine sacred precept, reigning and dispensing with you, the founder and disposer of all things, God, exhilarated for such a pious purpose with the innermost tears of the heart, we have begun to give thanks. |
| 89 | Quod tam laudabile, tam mirificum, tam saluberrimum, tam singulariter deo prae omnibus sacrificiis acceptabile tranquillitas vestra creditur opus concupisse, quod multis quidem pietate ac iustitia praeditis regibus desideratum, paucissimis tamen raroque ad effectum deo placitum cum sinceritate apostolicae fidei perduci possibile demonstratum. | That your serenity is believed to have desired a work so laudable, so wonderful, so salutary, so singularly acceptable to God above all sacrifices, which indeed was desired by many kings endowed with piety and justice, yet demonstrated to be possible to be brought to effect pleasing to God with the sincerity of the apostolic faith only rarely and by very few. |
| 90 | Et infra sequitur modo ulterius: «Praeterea satisfaciendum est nostro exiguo famulatui apud serenissimorum dominorum nostrorum clementiam pro tarditate missarum ex concilio nostro personarum, quos dirigi per suam augustissimam sacram vestrum piissimum fastigium iussit: Primum quidem quod numerosa multitudo nostrorum usque ad Oceani regiones extenditur, cuius itineris longinquitas in multi temporis cursum protelatur. | And below it follows further in this way: "Furthermore, satisfaction must be made to our small service at the clemency of our most serene lords for the slowness of the persons sent from our council, whom your most august sacred and most pious dignity ordered to be directed: First, the numerous multitude of ours extends even to the regions of the Ocean, the length of whose journey is prolonged into a long course of time. |
| 90 | Sperabamus de Britannia Theodorum, confamulum atque coepiscopum nostrum, magnae insulae Britanniae archiepiscopum, atque Philippum cum aliis, qui ibidem hactenus demorantur, exinde ad nostram humilitatem coniungere atque, ut diversos huius concilii episcopos in diversis regionibus constitutos ad generalitatem totius concilii servilis nostra suggestio adunaret, ne, si tantum pars, quod agebatur, cognosceret, partem lateret, maxime quia in medio gentium tam Langobardorum quam Sclavorum nec non Francorum, Gallorum atque Gothorum seu Britannorum plurimi confamulorum nostrorum esse noscuntur, qui et de hoc curiose satagere non desistunt, ut cognoscant, quid in causa apostolicae fidei peragatur, qui quantum prodesse possunt, dum in consonantia fidei nobiscum tenentur nobisque concorditer sentiunt, tantum, quod absit, si quid scandali in fidei capitulo patiantur, inveniuntur infesti atque contrarii. | We hoped to join Theodore from Britain, our fellow servant and co-bishop, archbishop of the great island of Britain, and Philip with others who remain there, to our humility, and that our humble suggestion would unite the various bishops of this council constituted in different regions to the generality of the whole council, lest, if only part knew what was being done, part should be hidden, especially since among the nations of the Lombards and Slavs, as well as the Franks, Gauls, and Goths or Britons, many of our fellow servants are known to be, who do not cease to strive curiously about this, to know what is being done in the cause of the apostolic faith, who, as much as they can help, while they are held with us in consonance of faith and feel in agreement with us, so much, God forbid, if they suffer anything of scandal in the chapter of faith, are found hostile and contrary. |
| 90 | Nos autem licet humillimi summis viribus enitemur, ut Christiani vestri imperii res publica, in qua beati Petri, apostolorum principis, sedes fundata est, cuius auctoritatem omnes Christianae nobiscum nationes venerantur et colunt, per ipsius beati Petri apostoli reverentiam omnium gentium sublimior esse monstratur. | We, however, although most humble, will strive with the greatest efforts, that the republic of your Christian empire, in which the see of blessed Peter, prince of the apostles, is founded, whose authority all Christian nations with us venerate and cultivate, may be shown to be more sublime than all nations through the reverence of the blessed apostle Peter himself. |
| 90 | Personas autem de nostrae humilitatis ordine praevidimus dirigere ad vestrae a deo protegendae fortitudinis vestigia, quae omnium nostrum, id est universorum per septentrionales vel occiduas regiones episcoporum, suggestionem, in qua et apostolicae nostrae fidei confessionem praelibavimus, offerre debeant, non tamquam de incertis contendere, sed ut certa et immutabilia compendiosa diffinitione proferre. | We have foreseen to direct persons from the order of our humility to the footsteps of your strength protected by God, which should offer the suggestion of all of us, that is, of all the bishops throughout the northern or western regions, in which we have also pre-tasted the confession of our apostolic faith, not as if contending about uncertain things, but as to bring forth a certain and immutable concise definition. |
| 90 | » Haec ibi. | " These things there. |
| 91 | Ex hoc habes, quomodo generale concilium patriarchale subiectum Romano pontifici est constitutum in septentrionalibus et occidentalibus provinciis. | From this you have how the general patriarchal council is constituted subject to the Roman pontiff in the northern and western provinces. |
| 91 | Africa etiam patriarchatui subest Romano, 12 di. | Africa also is subject to the Roman patriarchate, 12 distinctions. |
| 91 | Quis nesciat, ubi enumerantur provinciae Romanae sedi subiectae. | Who does not know where the provinces subject to the Roman see are enumerated? |
| 91 | Unde Flavianus, Constantinopolitanus patriarcha, ad Leonem papam scribens ait: «Omnibus, qui sub tua reverentia constituti sunt, deo amantissimis episcopis» etc. | Whence Flavian, patriarch of Constantinople, writing to Pope Leo, says: "To all the bishops most loving to God, who are constituted under your reverence," etc. |
| 91 | De quo etiam per Leonem ad Theodosium in epistula quae incipit: Olim ab initio. | Concerning which also through Leo to Theodosius in the letter which begins: "Olim ab initio." |
| 91 | Et pro hoc facit textus 2 q. | And for this the text of 2 q. 4 In omnibus makes, where it says: "of all our bishops" and 43 distinctions. |
| 91 | 4 In omnibus, ubi dicit: «nostrorum episcoporum omnium» et 43 di. | Next, where it says: "all the bishops who are subject to the ordination of this apostolic see" and Hilary the deacon to Pulcheria Augusta in a certain letter. |
| 91 | Iuxta, ubi dicit: «omnes episcopi, qui ordinationi huius apostolicae sedis subiacent» et Hilarius diaconus ad Pulcheriam augustam in quadam epistula. | However, as is found in the letter of Pope Nicholas to the Emperor Michael, then Thessalonica had the place of the apostolic see through Old and New Epirus, Illyricum, Macedonia, Thessaly, Achaea, Riparian and Mediterranean Dacia, Mysia, Dardania and Praevalis, and thus the greatest part, because the Roman patriarchate had almost all of Europe and a large part of Africa under it. |
| 91 | Tamen, ut habetur in epistula Nicolai papae ad Michaelem imperatorem, tunc Thessalonicensis vicem apostolicae sedis habuit per Epirum veterem et novum, Illyricum, Macedoniam, Thessaliam, Achaiam, Daciam riperensem et mediterraneam, Misiam, Dardaniam et Praevalim, et sic maximam partem, quoniam quasi totam Europam et Africae magnam partem patriarchatus Romanus sub se habuit. | However, as is found in the letter of Pope Nicholas to Emperor Michael, at that time he held the place of the apostolic see through Old and New Epirus, Illyricum, Macedonia, Thessaly, Achaea, riparian and Mediterranean Dacia, Mysia, Dardania, and Praevalis, and thus the greatest part, since the Roman patriarchate held almost all of Europe and a large part of Africa under its authority. |
| 92 | Hoc autem concilium patriarchale habet summum privilegium in eo, quod vocatur Romana ecclesia ad unam Romanam sedem adunata, quoniam in hiis quae fidei sunt numquam erravit neque errabit. | This patriarchal council holds the supreme privilege in that which is called the Roman Church united to the one Roman See, because in matters pertaining to the faith, it has never erred nor will it ever err. |
| 92 | Legitur enim in septima actione universalis octavi concilii quod ea, quae sedes apostolica synodice regulariterque decrevit, tanto studiosius oportet amplecti, tanto sollicitius observare, quanto satis noscitis, quae statuta fuerunt ab ea, haec universalem semper tenuisse ecclesiam, ita ut contra singulos errores in ecclesia exortos prior haec secundum sui primatus auctoritatem sententiae terminum dederit et ita demum universalis ecclesia; licet aliquando per aliquantum tempus in quibusdam reluctata sit, tamen demum probata probavit et refutavit refutata. | For it is read in the seventh session of the universal Eighth Council that what the Apostolic See has decreed synodically and regularly must be embraced with greater zeal and observed with greater care, inasmuch as it is well known that what has been established by it has always been upheld by the universal Church, such that against every error arising in the Church, this See has first set the limit of judgment according to the authority of its primacy, and only then the universal Church; although at times it resisted for a while in certain cases, in the end it approved what was proven and rejected what was refuted. |
| 92 | Haec ibi. | These things are there. |
| 92 | Unde ex hoc et aliis ibidem habetur papam in concilio suo, quae fidei sunt, unanimitate et concordantia coepiscoporum diffinire debere. | Hence, from this and other passages found there, it is held that the pope in his council ought to define matters of faith with the unanimity and agreement of his fellow bishops. |
| 92 | Dicitur enim ibi: «Decernentibus nobiscum et similiter considerantibus sanctissimis fratribus coepiscopis nostris. | For it is said there: "With our most holy fellow bishops decreeing with us and likewise deliberating." |
| 92 | » De quo 19 di. | On which, Distinction 19. |
| 92 | Anastasius et 24 q. | Anastasius and Question 24, Chapter 1. |
| 92 | 1 Loquitur in glossa. | The gloss speaks. |
| 93 | Quod autem istud concilium Romana ecclesia vocetur, ex superioribus patet. | That this council is called the Roman Church is clear from the above. |
| 93 | Et in prima actione octavi universalis concilii, ubi per legatos papae dicitur: «Legatur libellus, quem sancta Romanorum ecclesia exposuit»; qui libellus in concilio expositus fuit. | And in the first session of the Eighth Universal Council, where it is said through the pope’s legates: "Let the document which the holy Roman Church has set forth be read"; this document was presented in the council. |
| 93 | Et similiter in sexta actione in capitulo quod incipit: Multae quidem, ubi dicitur synodice cum tota Romanorum ecclesia Nicolaum papam anathema pronuntiasse. | Similarly, in the sixth session, in the chapter beginning "Multae quidem," it is said synodically that Pope Nicholas, with the entire Roman Church, pronounced anathema. |
| 93 | Ista Romana ecclesia semper stabilis in fide permanebit, sic quod ei non cohaerentes extra catholicam ecclesiam, exsistant, ut in gestis eiusdem concilii prima actione in libello per omnes subscripto continetur. | This Roman Church will always remain steadfast in the faith, so that those not adhering to it exist outside the Catholic Church, as is contained in the subscribed document in the first session of the same council’s proceedings. |
| 93 | Legitur enim ibidem quod libellus, quem Nicolaus papa in synodo dictavit, qui incipit: «Prima salus est rectae fidei regulam custodire, deinde a constitutis dei et patrum nullatenus deviare», et infra: «Et non potest domini nostri salvatoris sententia praetermitti dicentis: Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam. | For it is read there that the document which Pope Nicholas dictated in the synod, beginning "The first salvation is to keep the rule of right faith, then in no way to deviate from the decrees of God and the Fathers," and further: "Nor can the sentence of our Lord and Savior be overlooked, who said: 'You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.'" |
| 93 | Haec quae dicta sunt rerum probantur effectibus, quia in sede apostolica immaculata est semper observata religio et sancta celebrata doctrina», et in fine: «In qua est integra et vera Christianae religionis soliditas». | "These things that have been said are proven by their effects, because in the Apostolic See, religion has always been preserved unstained and holy doctrine celebrated," and at the end: "In which resides the whole and true solidity of the Christian religion." |
| 93 | Ille fuit per Adrianum ad concilium Constantinopolitanum octavum universale missus, et omnes se subscripserunt sic: «Sequimur autem sanctam synodum et amplectimur, quam beatae recordationis papa Nicolaus, cui et ipse, domine coangelice, summe pontifex Adriane, subscripsisti, ante sacratissimum Petri apostolorum eximii corpus celebravit, simul et quam tu ibi ipse nuper egisti, et omnia, quae in hiis statuta sunt, secundum decreti vestri moderationem venerabiliter conservabimus recipientes, quos recipiunt, et dampnantes omnes, qui in illis dampnati sunt». | This was sent by Adrian to the Eighth Universal Council of Constantinople, and all subscribed thus: "We follow and embrace the holy synod which Pope Nicholas of blessed memory, to whom you, O Lord co-angelic, supreme pontiff Adrian, subscribed, celebrated before the most sacred body of Peter, the chief of the apostles, as well as that which you yourself recently held there, and we shall reverently preserve all things decreed in these matters according to the moderation of your decree, receiving those whom they receive and condemning all who are condemned in them." |
| 93 | Haec ibi. | These things are there. |
| 94 | Ecce duo notanda: Sedem apostolicam pro tota synodo Romana capi, et quod profitens Romanam sedem errare non posse, intelligere vult per sedem totam synodum. | Note two things here: that the Apostolic See is taken for the whole Roman synod, and that by professing the Roman See cannot err, he intends to understand the entire synod through the See. |
| 94 | Secundo est notandum Constantinopolitanam sedem sequi in diffinitis, praesertim fidei, Romanam. | Second, it is to be noted that the Constantinopolitan See follows the Roman in defined matters, especially of faith. |
| 94 | Et ut habetur per apocrisarium apostolicae sedis, qui subscriptiones et gesta synodi praeveniendo vicarios apostolicae sedis caute Romam detulit, tunc imperator Basilius et patriarcha Ignatius poenituerunt de illa subscriptione episcoporum illius sedis Constantinopolitanae, ne apostolica sedes ex receptis subscriptionibus maioritatem super ipsam Constantinopolitanam argueret, quoniam professio cavebat, quomodo in omnibus sequerentur apostolicam sedem. | And as is held through the apocrisiary of the Apostolic See, who prudently brought the subscriptions and proceedings of the synod to Rome ahead of the vicars of the Apostolic See, Emperor Basil and Patriarch Ignatius later regretted the subscription of the bishops of that Constantinopolitan See, lest the Apostolic See, from the received subscriptions, accuse it of superiority over Constantinople, since the profession stipulated how they should follow the Apostolic See in all things. |
| 94 | Ideo procuravit imperator, ut per custodes deputatos per eum vicariis apostolicae sedis caperentur clam illae subscriptiones. | Therefore, the emperor arranged for those subscriptions to be secretly seized by guards appointed by him from the vicars of the Apostolic See. |
| 94 | Quod factum fuit, sed post hoc ex inductione vicariorum restitutae fuerunt. | This was done, but afterward, through the vicars’ intervention, they were restored. |
| 94 | Et fatebatur imperator apostolicam sedem magistram esse in fide, et ne periculum interveniret perdendi, apocrisarius, ut praedicitur, secrete Romam eas cum gestis detulit sequentibus vicariis, qui spoliati fuerunt in via. | The emperor confessed that the Apostolic See was the teacher in faith, and to avoid the danger of losing them, the apocrisiary, as mentioned, secretly brought them to Rome with the proceedings, following the vicars who were robbed on the way. |
| 94 | Similiter in sexta synodo in prima actione et aliis multis locis probatur stabilitas fidei Romanae ecclesiae. | Similarly, in the Sixth Synod, in the first session and many other places, the stability of the faith of the Roman Church is proven. |
| 95 | Ex istis habes duo, quae menti tenenda sunt: Scilicet quod concilium universale vel generale patriarchale subest et subiectum est Romano pontifici, et hoc in subscriptione legatorum papae et sui concilii in sexto et octavo conciliis deprehenditur, quia legati concilii sequuntur, facit &ladd§ Hinc etiam v. | From these, you have two things to hold in mind: namely, that a universal or general patriarchal council is subordinate and subject to the Roman Pontiff, and this is discerned in the subscription of the pope’s legates and his council in the Sixth and Eighth Councils, because the legates of the council follow... (Here and in the following, the text is interrupted). |
| 95 | &radd Illud 17 di. | That, Distinction 17. |
| 95 | , et sicut ipse habet principatum in fide et est iudex fidei, ut superius habetur, ita hoc suum concilium habet principatum inter omnia patriarchalia concilia in fide. | And just as he holds the primacy in faith and is the judge of faith, as stated above, so his council holds primacy among all patriarchal councils in faith. |
| 95 | Unde ex hoc secundo habes iudicium fidei, quod per papam et hoc concilium fit, esse tutissimum inter omnia particularium congregationum iudicia, licet infallibilius sit et tutius iudicium universalis concilii totius ecclesiae. | Hence, from this second point, you have that the judgment of faith made through the pope and this council is the safest among all judgments of particular congregations, though the judgment of the universal council of the whole Church is more infallible and secure. |
| 95 | Dicit enim imperator Marcianus, ut legitur in prima actione concilii Calcedonensis: «Cogitantes non esse tutum absque synodo et ubique sanctarum scripturarum praesulibus quaestionem de fide renovare» etc. | For Emperor Marcian says, as read in the first session of the Council of Chalcedon: "Considering it unsafe to renew a question of faith without a synod and the bishops of the holy Scriptures everywhere," etc. |
| 95 | Hodie autem prohdolor catholicae universalis ecclesiae et patriarchalis Romanae sedis unum est concilium, cum tota ecclesia redacta sit ad unum illum tantum patriarchatum. | Today, alas, the Catholic universal Church and the patriarchal Roman See are one council, since the whole Church has been reduced to that one patriarchate alone. |
| 95 | Quare sicut semper stetit iudicium ecclesiae Romanae modo praedicto captae in vera fide, ita nunc amplius stabit infallibilius sententia Christi, quoniam portae inferorum adversus eam numquam praevalebunt. | Therefore, just as the judgment of the Roman Church, captured in the true faith in the aforementioned way, has always stood firm, so now the sentence of Christ will stand even more infallibly, since the gates of hell shall never prevail against it. |
| 95 | Et haec est altera radix nostri propositi. | And this is the second root of our proposition. |
| 96 | Quomodo autem in Africano concilio ordinatio congregandorum conciliorum facta fuit et deinceps etiam apud sedem apostolicam servata, verbum unum submittam, quia praefigebatur locus, intimatio etiam, de qua re tractandum erat, fiebat metropolitanis, qui congregato provinciali concilio digesta materia ad locum legatum unum aut duos de provincia miserunt pro omnibus. | Now, as the arrangement for convening councils was made in the African council and thereafter also observed at the apostolic see, I shall submit one word, because the place was predetermined, and notification was also made to the metropolitans, who, having convened a provincial council, sent one or two legates from the province to the designated place on behalf of all. |
| 96 | Romanus autem pontifex ad urbem patriarchale concilium frequenter solitus fuit convocare, saepe etiam extra. | The Roman pontiff, however, was accustomed to frequently convene a patriarchal council in the city, and often also outside of it. |
| 96 | Inter tamen extra urbem celebrata fuit tempore Constantini secundum Arelatense, in quo apostolicae sedis Silvestrique papae legati Claudianus et Habitus presbyteri, Eugenius et Quiriacus diaconi et de omnibus tam Africae, Mauritaniae, Siciliae, Italiae, Galliae, Hispaniae, Germaniae quam aliarum omnium provinciarum sub patriarchatu Romano legati interfuisse leguntur. | Meanwhile, a council was celebrated outside the city in the time of Constantine, according to the Council of Arles, in which the legates of the apostolic see and of Pope Silvester, namely the priests Claudianus and Habitus, and the deacons Eugenius and Quiriacus, are read to have been present, representing all the provinces of Africa, Mauritania, Sicily, Italy, Gaul, Spain, Germany, and all other provinces under the patriarchate of Rome. |
| 96 | Habetur enim synodum seu concilium Romanae ecclesiae esse, ad quod seu ad quem de provinciis legati iuxta ipsius mandata convenerunt, uti haec in gestis sexti synodi colligi possunt. | For it is held that a synod or council of the Roman church is one to which legates from the provinces convene, according to its mandates, as can be gathered from the acts of the sixth synod. |
| 96 | Unde, ut ibidem colligitur, tunc subscriptiones aliorum in concilio exsistentium patriarchali annectebantur per hunc modum. | Whence, as is gathered from the same source, the subscriptions of others present at the council were then attached to the patriarchal one in this manner. |
| 96 | Primo enim subscribit Agatho sic: «Agatho, episcopus sanctae dei catholicae atque apostolicae ecclesiae urbis Romae, huic suggestioni cum generalitate totius apostolicae sedis concilii pro rectitudine apostolicae confessionis factae, sicut superius continetur, consensi atque subscripsi. | For Agatho subscribes first, saying: "Agatho, bishop of the holy catholic and apostolic church of the city of Rome, I have consented to and subscribed to this suggestion, made for the rectitude of the apostolic confession, as contained above, with the universality of the entire apostolic see's council." |
| 96 | » Et sequitur: «Andreas, gratia dei episcopus sanctae Ostiensis ecclesiae, in hanc suggestionem, quam pro apostolica nostra fide unanimiter construximus, similiter subscripsi. | And it follows: "Andreas, bishop of the holy church of Ostia, by the grace of God, I have similarly subscribed to this suggestion, which we have unanimously constructed for our apostolic faith." |
| 96 | » Et ita per ordinem omnes. | And so, in order, all the others have subscribed. |
| 96 | Et sequitur: «Adeodatus, humilis episcopus sanctae ecclesiae Leucorum, legatus venerabilis synodi per Galliarum provincias constituti, in hanc suggestionem, quam pro apostolica nostra fide unanimiter construximus, similiter subscripsi. | And it follows: "Adeodatus, humble bishop of the holy church of Leucorum, legate of the venerable synod constituted through the provinces of Gaul, I have similarly subscribed to this suggestion, which we have unanimously constructed for our apostolic faith." |
| 96 | » Et ita praecise Wilfredus, episcopus <Eboricenae>, legatus venerabilis synodi per Britanniam, subscripsit. | And thus, precisely, Wilfred, bishop of Eboricena, legate of the venerable synod through Britain, subscribed. |
| 96 | Unde, ut ibidem legitur, Felix Arelatensis et Taurinus diaconus <T>elonensis adiuncti fuerunt Adeodato pro tota Gallia, qui se omnes subscripserunt. | Whence, as is read in the same place, Felix of Arles and Taurinus, deacon of Telonensis, were joined to Adeodatus for all of Gaul, and they all subscribed. |
| 96 | Ex quo habes modum congregationis et deinde subscriptionis, et quomodo ex unanimi consensu prodiit iudicium, quod est singulariter notandum. | From this, you have the manner of congregation and then subscription, and how the judgment, which is singularly notable, proceeded from unanimous consent. |
| 96 | Sequitur modo in alio latere alia difficultas. | Now, another difficulty follows on the other side. |
| 97 | Capitulum VIII. | Chapter VIII. |
| 97 | Et ut aliam non parvam difficultatem semper sub correctione evacuem, quae habet dubium hoc, an statuta, quae in universalibus et aliis omnibus conciliis, ubi papa per se vel legatum praeest, per ipsum papam auctoritative consilio concilii concurrente fiant an concordanter per concilium, ideo oportet alias subscriptiones extra fidei materiam inquirere, de qua loquitur praecedens Agathonis, ut sic ex illis et aliis fundamenta eliciamus. | And so that I may always evacuate another not insignificant difficulty under correction, which has the doubt as to whether the statutes, which are made in universal and all other councils, where the pope presides either in person or through a legate, are made authoritatively by the pope with the conciliar counsel concurring, or in concord with the council, it is necessary to inquire into other subscriptions outside the matter of faith, about which the preceding statement of Agatho speaks, so that we may thus elicit the foundations from these and others. |
| 97 | Et primo: In omnibus universalibus universalis ecclesiae conciliis invenio legatos papae absque differentia pariformiter aliis se subscripsisse. | And first: In all universal councils of the universal church, I find the legates of the pope to have subscribed without difference, just like the others. |
| 97 | Unde unusquisque episcopus vel dicit: annuens vel: consentiens vel: statuens vel: diffiniens subscripsi. | Whence each bishop says: "I, assenting" or "I, consenting" or "I, establishing" or "I, defining, have subscribed." |
| 97 | Ita pariformiter apostolicae sedis legati, et dico legati papae, quia in octo universalibus conciliis non invenio papam per se interfuisse. | Thus, the legates of the apostolic see, and I say the legates of the pope, because in the eight universal councils, I do not find the pope to have been present in person. |
| 97 | Unde, ut sciatur hoc dubium non habere, pauca ex gestis Calcedonensis concilii de depositione Dioscori imponam. | Whence, so that it may be known that this doubt does not exist, I shall impose a few things from the acts of the Council of Chalcedon regarding the deposition of Dioscorus. |
| 97 | Postquam enim Dioscorus tertio monitus noluit comparere, tunc Pascasinus, legatus Leonis papae, ad synodum dixit: «Volumus ediscere a vestra sanctitate, qua poena dignus sit. | For after Dioscorus, having been warned three times, refused to appear, Pascasinus, the legate of Pope Leo, said to the synod: "We wish to learn from your sanctity what penalty he is worthy of." |
| 97 | » Sancta synodus dixit: «Quae placita sunt canonibus, fiant. | The holy synod said: "Let what is pleasing to the canons be done." |
| 97 | » Pascasinus dixit: «Iubet reverentia vestra, ut ultione canonica contra eum utamur? | Pascasinus said: "Does your reverence command that we use canonical vengeance against him?" |
| 97 | Consentitis an aliud placet? | "Do you consent, or is something else pleasing to you?" |
| 97 | » Sancta synodus dixit: «Etiam consentimus. | The holy synod said: "We also consent." |
| 97 | Nullus dissentit, totius synodi voluntas est una. | No one dissents; the will of the entire synod is one. |
| 97 | » Iulianus, episcopus Hipponensis, dixit ad legatos Leonis: «Petimus vestram sanctitatem in eo, quod magis inter ceteros eminetis habentes locum sanctissimi papae Leonis, iustam in contumacem promulgare vindictam ac regulis insitam contra eum ferre sententiam. | Julian, bishop of Hippo, said to the legates of Leo: "We ask your sanctity, inasmuch as you hold the place of the most holy Pope Leo, to promulgate just vengeance against the contumacious one and to pronounce a sentence against him, in accordance with the rules." |
| 97 | Omnes enim nos et sancta synodus concors efficitur vestrae sententiae sanctitatis. | For we all, and the holy synod, are in concord with your sanctity's sentence. |
| 97 | » Pascasinus dixit: «Quod placet beatitudini vestrae, unanimiter proferatur. | Pascasinus said: "Let what is pleasing to your beatitude be unanimously proclaimed." |
| 97 | » Maximus, Antiochenus episcopus, dixit: «Quod videtur sanctitati vestrae censendum, in hoc concordes efficimur simul. | Maximus, bishop of Antioch, said: "We are made concordant in this, inasmuch as what seems to your sanctity is censured." |
| 97 | » Post hoc legati apostolici pronuntiarunt sententiam, quomodo Leo papa deposuisset Dioscorum et eum dampnasset, et subiungunt: «Sancta haec synodus, quae placent canonicis regulis, super memorato Dioscoro decernere non moretur. | After this, the apostolic legates pronounced the sentence, inasmuch as Pope Leo had deposed Dioscorus and condemned him, and they add: "This holy synod, which is pleasing to the canonical rules, does not hesitate to decree regarding the aforementioned Dioscorus." |
| 97 | » Anatolius, archiepiscopus Constantinopolitanus, et quisque de concilio sententiam dedit dicendo: «Eum alienum iudico omnis sacerdotalis sive episcopalis ministerii. | Anatolius, archbishop of Constantinople, and each one of the council gave their sentence, saying: "I judge him to be alien to all sacerdotal or episcopal ministry." |
| 97 | » Ecce, quod legati apostolici in concilio, quia primo loco exsistunt, prius proferunt sententiam, si synodus iubet, et post illos omnes secundum ordinem, et ex unitate voluntatis et concordia dependet sententiae vigor. | Behold, what the apostolic legates in the council, because they exist in the first place, first proclaim the sentence, if the synod commands, and after them, all the others, according to order, and the vigor of the sentence depends on the unity of will and concord. |
| 97 | Vides etiam quod sententia sedis apostolicae depositionis Dioscori per novam citationem Dioscori iuxta canonicas regulas in universali synodo fuit iterum examinata, quod ob sequentia infra menti tenendum exsistit. | You also see that the sentence of the apostolic see regarding the deposition of Dioscorus was re-examined in a universal synod, according to the canonical rules, through a new citation of Dioscorus, which is to be held in mind for the following reasons. |
| 97 | Habes formam universalium conciliorum. | You have the form of universal councils. |
| 98 | Pariformiter in aliis Romanorum pontificum conciliis subscriptiones factas reperio. | I find subscriptions made in other councils of the Roman pontiffs. |
| 98 | Ita enim in concilio Martini papae, quod praecessit sextam universalem synodum, reperio Martinum sic subscripsisse: «Martinus, sanctae catholicae et apostolicae ecclesiae episcopus urbis Romae, huic diffinitioni confirmationis orthodoxae fidei et dampnation<is> Sergii Constantinopolitani, Pyrrhi et Pauli statuens subscripsi. | For in the council of Pope Martin, which preceded the sixth ecumenical synod, I find Martin subscribing thus: "Martin, bishop of the holy catholic and apostolic Church of Rome, having established this definition of the orthodox faith and the condemnation of Sergius of Constantinople, Pyrrhus, and Paul, I have subscribed to it." |
| 98 | » Et sic Maximus sanctae Aquileiensis ecclesiae praecise confirmando, dampnando et statuendo una cum 103 episcopis se subscripsit, quisque in eadem forma. | And thus Maximus, bishop of the holy Church of Aquileia, precisely confirming, condemning, and establishing, subscribed along with 103 bishops, each in the same form. |
| 98 | Sic reperio in concilio, cui Gregorius papa iunior tempore Leonis et Constantini iunioris imperatoris Romae praesedit, subscriptiones factas: «Gregorius, sanctae catholicae et apostolicae ecclesiae urbis Romae episcopus, huic constituto a nobis promulgato subscripsi. | I find subscriptions made in the council in which Pope Gregory the Younger presided during the reign of Emperor Leo and Constantine the Younger in Rome: "Gregory, bishop of the holy catholic and apostolic Church of Rome, I have subscribed to this constitution promulgated by us." |
| 98 | Agnellus, episcopus sanctae ecclesiae Ferentinensis, huic constituto a nobis promulgato subscripsi. | Agnellus, bishop of the holy Church of Ferentino, I have subscribed to this constitution promulgated by us. |
| 98 | » Et similiter subscripserunt episcopi numero 21, presbyteri 14 et diaconi 4. | And similarly, 21 bishops, 14 priests, and 4 deacons subscribed. |
| 98 | Similiter in synodo Symmachi legitur. | Similarly, it is read in the synod of Symmachus. |
| 98 | Nam tempore Theoderici regis 218 episcopi in concilio Symmacho praesidente in sexta actione leguntur dixisse: «Sanctorum patrum statuta firmantes expressis sententiis sanximus. | For in the council of Symmachus, presided over by King Theodoric, 218 bishops are recorded in the sixth action as having said: "Strengthening the statutes of the holy fathers, we have decreed by express pronouncements." |
| 98 | » Symmachus, episcopus ecclesiae catholicae, dixit: «Quod si aliqui haec transgressi fuerint et talia praesumpserint, quod super hiis vobis videtur, pari adunatione manifestate. | Symmachus, bishop of the Catholic Church, said: "If any have transgressed these things and presumed such matters, let it be made manifest to you by a similar assembly." |
| 98 | » Cumque surrexissent et paulo post iterum consedissent, dixerunt: «Si quis haec hodie in hac sancta synodo prohibita infringere praesumpserit, si clericus est, gradu proprio careat, si monachus vel laicus, communione privetur», et infra: «Dum resedissent, facto silentio universa synodus dixit: Quisquis clericorum aut monachorum vel laicorum tam maioris ordinis quam etiam inferioris post hanc formam a nobis prolatam hiis decretis contraire praesumpserit, statutis canonicis velut scismaticus procellatur. | And when they had risen and shortly after had again sat down, they said: "If anyone today in this holy synod presumes to infringe upon the prohibitions, if he is a cleric, let him be deprived of his rank; if a monk or layman, let him be deprived of communion," and further: "While they were seated, silence having been made, the entire synod said: Whoever of the clergy or monks or laymen, of whatever higher or lower order, after this form promulgated by us, presumes to contradict these decrees, is declared to be a schismatic according to the canonical statutes." |
| 98 | » Et subscripserunt: «Caelius Symmachus, episcopus sanctae catholicae ecclesiae urbis Romae, huic constituto a nobis inspirante domino peracto subscripsi. | And they subscribed: "Caecilius Symmachus, bishop of the holy Catholic Church of Rome, having completed this constitution inspired by the Lord, I have subscribed." |
| 98 | Laurentius, episcopus sanctae Mediolanensis ecclesiae, huic constituto a nobis inspirante domino peracto subscripsi. | Laurence, bishop of the holy Church of Milan, having completed this constitution inspired by the Lord, I have subscribed." |
| 98 | Eulalius, episcopus Syracusanae, etc. | Eulalius, bishop of Syracuse, etc. |
| 98 | » Similiter omnes subscripserunt. | Similarly, all subscribed. |
| 98 | Et in sexta actione dicit Symmachus papa, quomodo aliqua statuta renovanda sunt et quaedam corrigenda, subiungens modo: «Quia deus praesentiam vestram votivam mihi concessit, necesse est rem fieri firmam, quam credo ecclesiasticis facultatibus convenire. | And in the sixth action, Pope Symmachus says how certain statutes should be renewed and some corrected, adding in this way: "Since God has granted me your voluntary presence, it is necessary to make the matter firm, which I believe to be fitting for the ecclesiastical faculties." |
| 98 | » Et subscripsit: «Caelius Symmachus etc. | And he subscribed: "Caecilius Symmachus, etc." |
| 98 | hiis constitutis synodalibus a nobis probatis et confirmatis subscripsi. | Having approved and confirmed these synodal constitutions, I have subscribed." |
| 98 | » Et pariformiter omnes subscripserunt. | And similarly, all subscribed. |
| 99 | Similiter reperio in concilio Papiae celebrato per Bonifatium papam contra clericos concubinarios subscriptiones factas. | Similarly, I find subscriptions made in the council of Pavia, celebrated by Pope Boniface, against adulterous clergy. |
| 99 | Ecce, quia omnis subscriptio consensum ostendit et firmitatem; ita legitur in sexto capitulo Africani concilii, ubi Gennadius dixit: «Quae ab omnibus sunt dicta, propria debemus subscriptione roborare. | Behold, because every subscription demonstrates consent and firmness; thus it is read in the sixth chapter of the African council, where Gennadius said: "What has been said by all, we must strengthen by our own subscription." |
| 99 | » Et ab universis episcopis dictum est: «Fiat, fiat. | And it was said by all the bishops: "Let it be done, let it be done." |
| 99 | » Ut etiam vicarii senioris Romae in conclusione octavi universalis concilii dixerunt: «Quoniam providentia dei in prosperum finem omnia devenerunt negotia ecclesiae, oportet nos in scriptis manu propria haec roborare secundum synodicam consequentiam», ut haec circa finem gestorum leguntur eiusdem concilii. | So too, the vicars of the senior Roman Church in the conclusion of the eighth ecumenical council said: "Since by the providence of God all the affairs of the Church have come to a successful conclusion, it is fitting for us to strengthen these in writing with our own hand, according to the synodical sequence," as these are read near the end of the acts of the same council. |
| 99 | Ideo ad firmitatem et consensum manifestandum et ad omnia roborandum quae actitabantur episcoporum subscriptiones secundum synodicam consequentiam annectebantur in fine. | Therefore, to manifest firmness and consent and to strengthen all that was transacted, the subscriptions of the bishops were appended according to the synodical sequence at the end. |
| 99 | Ita reperitur in Toletano concilio quodam: Hiis vero omnibus finem et robur subscriptione nostra facientes; et sequitur: «Ego, Eugenius, Toletanae ecclesiae episcopus metropolitanus, hiis communibus decretis annuens subscripsi. | Thus it is found in a certain Toledo council: Having made an end and given strength to all these things by our subscription; and it follows: "I, Eugene, metropolitan bishop of the Church of Toledo, having agreed to these common decrees, have subscribed." |
| 99 | » Similiter et alii episcopi subscripserunt. | Similarly, other bishops subscribed. |
| 99 | Ita in alio, in quo fuit Isidorus, dicitur: «Omnia propria subscriptione, ut permaneant, roboramus. | Thus in another, in which Isidore was present, it is said: "We strengthen all things by our own subscription, so that they may remain." |
| 99 | » Et hoc invenitur in fine omnium conciliorum. | And this is found at the end of all councils. |
| 100 | Ex qua re sequitur iuxta subscriptiones praetactas vigorem statutorum canonum in concilio non ex papa nec capite concilii, sed ex unico concordanti consensu vigorem habere. | From which it follows, according to the aforementioned subscriptions, that the force of the canonical statutes in the council does not derive from the pope or the head of the council, but from the unanimous concordant consent. |
| 100 | Talia enim statuta catholicae ecclesiae communi consensu edita Nicaena synodus redeuntes de haeresi voluit profiteri debere et de aliis non loquitur, 1 q. | For such statutes, issued by the common consent of the Catholic Church, the Nicene synod, returning from heresy, wished to profess, and does not speak of other things. |
| 100 | 7 Si qui voluerint. | 7 If anyone wishes. |
| 100 | Et si aliquando reperitur papam de consilio concilii hoc statuisse, quod tamen numquam legitur in antiquis conciliis, hoc tamen de consilio affirmativo, per quod consensus habebatur, intelligendum est. | And if sometimes a pope is found to have decreed this by the council's advice, which, however, is never read in the ancient councils, this is nevertheless to be understood by affirmative advice, by which consent was obtained. |
| 100 | Nam nulli dubium, quin provinciale concilium statuere non possit ea, quae ad totam provinciam spectant, sine capite archiepiscopo, qui iudex est provinciae, ut notatur per Archidiaconum 17 di. | For no one doubts that a provincial council cannot decree those things which pertain to the whole province without the head bishop, who is the judge of the province, as is noted by the Archdeacon. |
| 100 | Generalia, 9 q. | General, 9 q. |
| 100 | 3 c. | 3 c. |
| 100 | 1 et 2, nisi non vellet vel non posset, puta quia mortuus, interesse, ut notatur 18 di. | 1 and 2, unless he did not wish or could not, for example, because he was dead, to be present, as is noted 18 di. |
| 100 | Placuit. | It was pleasing. |
| 100 | Tamen statuta, quae ipsis conciliis provincialibus dictata inveniuntur, non eapropter ascribuntur metropolitano de consensu concilii, sed variis peritis, qui in concilio fuerunt auctores canonum, ut haec per ordinem habentur 16 di. | However, the statutes which are found to have been dictated to the provincial councils themselves are not therefore ascribed to the metropolitan by the council's consent, but to the various experts who were in the council, the authors of the canons, as these are held in order 16 di. |
| 100 | Sexta § Annotatio. | Sixth § Annotation. |
| 100 | Nec propter auctoritatem dictantium fuerunt canones, sed quia aliorum consilium concurrebat et similiter consensus, qui ex subscriptione convincitur. | Nor were the canons because of the authority of those who dictated them, but because the counsel of others concurred and similarly the consent, which is proven by the subscription. |
| 101 | Capitulum IX. | Chapter IX. |
| 101 | Est superius manifestatum quod synodalis auctoritas ex potestate ligandi et solvendi ecclesiae et sacerdotio a Christo tradita robur accipit, cum eo, quod in medio congregatorum propter nomen Christi Christus indubie est, et congregatis in unum spiritus domini inspirat. | It has been manifested above that synodal authority receives strength from the power of binding and loosing of the Church and the priesthood handed down by Christ, with the fact that Christ is undoubtedly in the midst of those gathered together for the name of Christ, and the Spirit of the Lord inspires those gathered together in one. |
| 101 | Est secundum hoc in Nicaena synodo diffinitum, quod, quae sunt per unamquamque provinciam, synodus provinciae habet dispensare, 9 q. | It is defined in this way in the Nicene synod that what pertains to each province, the synod of the province has the power to dispense, 9 q. |
| 101 | 2 Episcopi, 3 q. | 2 Bishops, 3 q. |
| 101 | 6 Neminem § Illa, et gubernare et administrare habet omnia ex eadem diffinitione Nicaeni concilii, 9 q. | 6 No one § That, and has the power to govern and administer everything from the same definition of the Nicene council, 9 q. |
| 101 | 2 Non invitati, et omnia exorta infra provinciam a comprovincialibus audiri debent et terminari, ut in allegato § Illa. | 2 Not invited, and all that arises within the province should be heard and concluded by the comprovincials, as in the cited § That. |
| 101 | Ex quo patet quod, quia concilium ex consensu constituitur, quoniam, ubi dissensio, ibi non est concilium, 15 di. | From which it is clear that because the council is constituted by consent, since where there is dissent, there is no council, 15 di. |
| 101 | Canones § Synodus, tunc non potest radicalius fundamentum canonum investigari quam concordantia. | Canons § Synod, then the foundation of the canons cannot be more thoroughly investigated than by concordance. |
| 101 | Ecclesiastici enim canones non possunt nisi per ecclesiasticam congregationem, quae synodus vel coetus dicitur, statui. | For ecclesiastical canons cannot be established except by an ecclesiastical assembly, which is called a synod or assembly. |
| 101 | Et ideo nisi, quiscumque ille fuerit, aut papa aut patriarcha, decreta secundum canones ecclesiasticos promulgaverit, non possunt illa statuta canones sive ecclesiastica statuta vocari, et nihil habent firmitatis cuiuscumque particularis statuta, nisi inquantum per acceptationem et usum seu consensum confirmentur seu canonibus consentiant. | And therefore, unless anyone, whether pope or patriarch, has promulgated decrees according to the ecclesiastical canons, those statutes cannot be called canons or ecclesiastical statutes, and they have no firmness whatsoever, unless they are confirmed by acceptance and use or consent, or agree with the canons. |
| 101 | Unde textus Leonis papae de epistulis suorum praedecessorum, 19 di. | Whence the text of Pope Leo on the letters of his predecessors, 19 di. |
| 101 | Si Romanorum, et Damasi papae, 25 q. | If Roman, and of Pope Damasus, 25 q. |
| 101 | 1 Omnium, loquuntur de decretalibus et epistulis de canonum disciplinis promulgatis. | 1 All, speak of decretals and letters concerning the disciplines of the canons promulgated. |
| 102 | Non volo negare, quin ex virtute et potestate divina ac etiam praecepto, quo oboediendum est praepositis et quo subiecti esse debemus regibus, superiores statuendi et ordinandi secundum commissam curam habeant potestatem. | I do not deny that, by virtue of divine power and authority, and even by the precept that we must obey those who are placed over us and those who are subject to them, those who are superior have the power to establish and ordain according to their care. |
| 102 | Sed dico quod statutorum obligatorialis virtus cum hoc requirit consensum per usum et acceptationem. | I say, however, that the obligatory force of statutes requires consent through use and acceptance. |
| 102 | Statuta Africana non ligassent Gallos, nisi Carolus ab Adriano papa in duobus breviariis recepta ea ad Galliam detulisset et sic Gallia acceptasset. | The African statutes would not bind the Gauls unless Charles, having received them from Pope Adrian in two breviaries, had brought them to Gaul and the Gauls had accepted them. |
| 102 | Unde in concilio Toletano 627 Christi anno celebrato conversis omnibus de Ariana haeresi ad fidem dicit synodus: «Constitutiones vero sanctorum conciliorum Nicaeni, Ephesini, Constantinopolitani et Calcedonensis, quas gratissima aure audivimus et consensione nostra vera approbavimus, de toto corde et anima subscripsimus. | Wherefore, in the council of Toledo in the year of Christ 627, when all were converted from the Arian heresy to the faith, the synod said: "The constitutions of the holy councils of Nicaea, Ephesus, Constantinople, and Chalcedon, which we have heard with the greatest pleasure and have truly approved with our consent, we subscribe with our whole heart and soul." |
| 102 | » Ecce, dicit synodus: «consensione nostra» et in alio concilio Toletano: «Hoc nobis placet, ut, si quis cognitis gestis Nicaeni concilii aliud quam statutum est, facere praesumpserit et non in eo perseverandum putaverit, tunc excommunicatus habeatur, nisi per correctionem fratrum se emendaverit. | "Behold, the synod says: 'our consent' and in another council of Toledo: 'it pleases us that, if anyone presumes to do something other than what was established by the council of Nicaea and does not think it should be persevered in, then let him be excommunicated, unless he corrects himself through the correction of his brothers.'" |
| 102 | » Et frequenter invenitur in omnibus conciliis confirmatio canonum praeteritorum conciliorum per viam innovationis, ut de consensu et acceptatione appareat: si forte abrogatio per non-usum introducta fuisset, sic tolleretur. | "And it is frequently found in all councils that the confirmation of the canons of previous councils is confirmed through the way of innovation, so that it may appear by consent and acceptance: if an abrogation were introduced through non-use, it would be abolished." |
| 103 | Capitulum X. | Chapter X. |
| 103 | Est et illud manifestum, si cuiuslibet provinciae dispositio ad eius synodum in omnibus spectat, quod tunc nulla constitutio nisi approbata per synodum ligat. | It is also evident that the disposition of any province is directed towards its synod in all things, and then no constitution binds unless it is approved by the synod. |
| 103 | Omnis enim lex debet patriae, loco et tempori convenire, 4 di. | For every law must be suitable to the country, place, and time, 4 days. |
| 103 | Erit autem, 29 di. | It will be, 29 days. |
| 103 | per totum, et haec examinare habet synodus provinciae. | for the whole, and this is examined by the synod of the province. |
| 103 | Loquor de positivis humanis constitutionibus. | I speak of positive human constitutions. |
| 103 | Oportet enim, quod omnia talia quae ligare debent, contineantur in auctoritatibus sacrarum scripturarum, statutis episcoporum in conciliis editis aut consuetudine universalis ecclesiae. | For it is necessary that all such things that bind be contained in the authorities of the sacred scriptures, the statutes of bishops in councils, or the custom of the universal church. |
| 103 | Alia omnia resecari debent, 12 di. | All other things must be cut off, 12 days. |
| 103 | Omnis, et est textus Augustini. | Every, and is the text of Augustine. |
| 103 | Ecce, quod excludit omnia alia. | Behold, what excludes all other things. |
| 103 | Quare vigor particularium statutorum quoad hoc, quod subditi per ea ligentur, requirit usum et acceptationem. | Wherefore the force of particular statutes, as far as this is concerned, that subjects are bound by them, requires use and acceptance. |
| 103 | Unde usu leges firmantur et utentium moribus approbantur, 4 di. | Whereby laws are established by use and approved by the customs of those who use them, 4 days. |
| 103 | Leges. | Laws. |
| 103 | Et hoc etiam verum in statutis Romani pontificis, quae per non-usum vigorem perdunt, ut ibidem probatur in c. | And this is also true in the statutes of the Roman pontiff, which lose their vigor through non-use, as is proven in c. |
| 103 | Statuimus et c. | We have established and c. |
| 103 | Denique. | Finally. |
| 104 | Unde est sciendum quod constitutiones quasi simul stationes, De sententia excommunicationis Inter alia, licet aliter dicat Hostiensis in Summa, De constitutionibus § Unde dicatur. | Wherefore it is to be known that constitutions are like stations, by the judgment of excommunication, although Hostiensis says otherwise in his Summa, De constitutionibus § Wherefore it is said. |
| 104 | Et proprie sunt canones, qui ab omnibus servari debent, ut in c. | And properly are canons, which must be observed by all, as in c. |
| 104 | 1 De constitutionibus. | 1 De constitutionibus. |
| 104 | In veteribus omnibus libris solum nominantur illi canones, qui per synodos constituti sunt, quoniam, licet metropolitanus habeat curam et sollicitudinem provinciae, 9 q. | In all old books they are only called canons that were established by synods, because, although the metropolitan has care and solicitude for the province, 9 q. |
| 104 | 3 Per singulas, tamen statuta generalia totam provinciam respicientia edere nequit, sed oportet quod constituat, id est cum aliis suffraganeis statuat, quoniam in hac concordia gaudet altissimus et gloriatur in membris suis, 9 q. | 3 Through each, yet general statutes that regard the whole province cannot be issued, but it is necessary that they establish, that is, with others, the suffragan bishops, establish, because the highest rejoices and glories in his members, 9 q. |
| 104 | 3 Archiepiscopus, ut uno ore concorditer glorificetur trinitas in ecclesia, eadem c. | 3 The archbishop, so that the Trinity may be glorified in the church with one voice, eadem c. |

| 105 | Capitulum XI. | Chapter XI. |
| 105 | Et licet apostolicis salubribus monitis sit oboediendum, 12 di. | And although it is to be obeyed to apostolic salutary admonitions, 12 days. |
| 105 | Apostolicis, et licet etiam sit fatendum Romanum pontificem potestatem statuendi habere a deo, ut notat glossa De electione Generali in Sexto, et quod hanc potestatem nemo ab eo tollere potest, ut notatur 2 di. | Apostolic, and although it is also to be admitted that the Roman pontiff has the power to establish, as is noted by the gloss De electione Generali in Sexto, and that no one can take this power away from him, as is noted 2 c. |
| 105 | c. | Whoever. |
| 105 | 2 per Archidiaconum et Antonium de Butrio De translatione c. | 1, yet it must be understood in a limited sense according to what is said at the end of this second part, yet in order that his statute binds, it is not sufficient that it is publicly promulgated, but it is necessary that it be accepted and approved by use according to the above and what is noted De constitutionibus super rubrica, where it is said by the doctors that three things are necessary for the validity of a statute: the power of the one establishing, the approval of the statute by use, and its publication. |
| 105 | 1, quod tamen limitate intelligendum est secundum ea, quae in fine huius partis secundae dicuntur, tamen ad hoc, quod statutum suum liget, non sufficit quod sit publice promulgatum, sed oportet quod acceptetur et per usum approbetur secundum superiora et ea, quae notantur De constitutionibus super rubrica, ubi dicitur per doctores quod ad validitatem statuti tria sunt necessaria: potestas in statuente, approbatio statuti per usum et eiusdem publicatio. | Wherefore we see innumerable apostolic statutes, even from the beginning, after they were published, were not accepted. |
| 105 | Unde videmus innumera apostolica statuta etiam a principio, postquam edita fuere, non fuisse acceptata. | In all of which the rule is that which is held 4 di. |
| 105 | In quibus omnibus regula est quae habetur 4 di. | §: Although these things are established by laws, because they are not approved by common use, those who do not observe them are not accused of transgression, otherwise those who do not obey them would be deprived of their honor. |
| 105 | §: Haec etsi legibus constituta sint, quia communi usu approbata non sunt, se non observantes transgressionis reos non arguunt, alioquin hiis non oboedientes proprio privarentur honore. | For these laws or statutes are not said to be despised or transgressed by anyone, because the law is not yet effective. |
| 105 | Tales enim leges sive statuta nullus dicitur contempnere vel transgredi, quia nondum efficax lex est. | But if the law were and accepted, then if anyone does not keep it, because his will is not subject to the reason of the law, then he is a transgressor through contempt, otherwise, if he is led by anger or concupiscence, as notably says Archidiaconus 81 di. |
| 105 | Verum si lex foret et acceptata, tunc si quis eam non servat ex eo, quia voluntas eius est non subici rationi legis, tunc est transgressor ex contemptu, secus, si ductus ira vel concupiscentia, ut notabiliter dicit Archidiaconus 81 di. | c. |
| 105 | c. | Whoever. |
| 105 | Quicumque. | From which it is held that canonical statutes are rightly those that are established by synod, because the synod represents, according to its quality or province or kingdom or universal church. |
| 106 | Ex quo habetur quod recte illa sunt canonica statuta, quae sunt synodice constituta, quoniam synodus repraesentat secundum suam qualitatem aut provinciam aut regnum aut universalem ecclesiam. | For whatever is established by synod in this way, it brings with it acceptance and confirmation, although the strength lies in use. |
| 106 | Quidquid enim synodice sic constituitur, secum apportat et acceptationem et confirmationem, licet robur in usu vigeat. | Wherefore all those laws that speak of apostolic seat statutes, 19 di. |
| 106 | Quare omnia illa iura, quae loquuntur de statutis apostolicae sedis, 19 di. | , especially c. |
| 106 | , praesertim c. | None is, I think, to be understood of synodal statutes of the same seat, as the text says, or at least of the seat itself, which is not taken for the pope alone, but also for the cardinals – today exercising the legation of the whole Roman church and also the universal – whose pope is said to be the mouth, because through the pope the seat speaks. |
| 106 | Nulli fas, puto intelligi debere de statutis synodicis ipsius sedis, ut ibi textus dicere videtur, aut saltem de ipsa sede, quae non capitur pro papa tantum, sed pro cardinalibus etiam – hodie legatione totius Romanae ecclesiae et etiam universalis fungentes. | And therefore apostolic letters are called the letters of the Roman pontiffs, which have the force of statutes, because through the consent of the synod of metropolitan bishops, who once convened at the seat, they decreed the same. |
| 107 | Cuius quidem sedis papa os dicitur, quoniam per papam ipsa sedes loquitur. | Wherefore in the synod of Toledo in the year of Christ 627, during the time of King Recared, when all the bishops of Spain and Gaul were gathered in the first chapter of the statutes, which preceded the chapters of orthodox faith, because all were returning from the Arian heresy to the Catholic faith, it is written: "Now, with the mercy of the church of Christ restored, let all that the authority of the ancient canons forbids be inhibited, and let all that was commanded be done; let the constitutions of all councils remain in their vigor, and the synodal letters of the holy bishops of Rome be observed." |
| 107 | Et ideo apostolicae epistulae vocantur illae Romanorum pontificum epistulae, quae vigorem statutorum habent, quoniam per consensum synodi quondam metropolitanorum concurrentium annue ad sedem papa easdem dictavit. | And in another council of Toledo, held during the time of King Sisenand, c. |
| 107 | Unde in synodo Toletana anno Christi 627 tempore Recaredi regis ex omnium episcoporum Hispaniae et Galliae collecta in primo capitulo statutorum praemissis capitulis fidei orthodoxae, quoniam de Ariana haeresi revertebantur omnes ad catholicam fidem, ita legitur: «At nunc pace ecclesiae Christi misericordia reparata omne, quod priscorum canonum auctoritas prohibet, sit resurgente disciplina inhibitum et agatur omne quod praecepit; permaneant in suo vigore conciliorum omnium constituta simul et synodicae sanctorum praesulum Romanorum epistulae. | 17 it is said: "The book of the Apocalypse will describe the authority of many councils and the synodal decrees of the holy bishops of Rome, and they decreed that it should be placed among the divine books" etc. |
| 107 | » Ac in alio concilio Toletano tempore Sisenandi regis celebrato c. | " And in another Toletan council celebrated during the time of King Sisenand, c. |
| 107 | 17 dicit: «Apocalypsis librum multorum conciliorum auctoritas et synodica sanctorum Romanorum praesulum decreta Ioannis evangelistae esse describunt, et inter divinos libros constituendum decreverunt» etc. | 17 says: "The authority of many councils and the synodal decrees of the holy Roman prelates describe the book of Revelation as being written by John the Evangelist, and they decreed that it should be included among the divine books" etc. |
| 108 | Ecce, quod synodicae epistulae decreta dicuntur. | Behold, what the synodal letters are said to decree. |
| 108 | Et ex hoc habetur approbationem librorum, quae Gelasio papae ascribitur, fuisse synodicam, ut hoc in Burcardo in tertio libro habetur, ubi dicitur 70 episcopos in concilio illo fuisse, et probat textus 96 di. | And from this it is obtained that the approval of the books attributed to Pope Gelasius was synodal, as is stated in Burcard in the third book, where it is said that 70 bishops were present at that council, and the text proves 96 dioceses. |
| 108 | Constantinus. | Constantine. |
| 108 | Etiam illi textus Nicolai papae, Gelasii et aliorum qui dicunt: «sub excommunicatione decreta, per Romanum pontificem promulgata pro correctione morum et disciplina» etc. | Likewise, those texts of Pope Nicholas, Gelasius, and others which say: "decreed under excommunication, promulgated by the Roman pontiff for the correction of morals and discipline," etc. |
| 108 | , intelligi debent secundum Hincmarum, subtilissimum archiepiscopum Remensem, cuius laudes idem Nicolaus papa 11 q. | must be understood according to Hincmar, the most subtle archbishop of Mainz, whose praises the same Pope Nicholas 11 q. |
| 108 | 3 Excellentissimus extollit, de promulgatis, id est quae papa vulgo promit de disciplinis sacrorum canonum vel ipsius synodi apostolici, quae sedes apostolica saepe dicitur, cuius ipse os est. | 3 highly extols, concerning promulgations, that is, what the pope commonly promises regarding the disciplines of sacred canons or of the synod itself of the apostolic see, which is often called the apostolic seat, of which he himself is the mouth. |

| 108 | Et si de papa tantum intelligi deberent, tunc oportet quod intelligantur iuxta praemissa, scilicet de statutis acceptatis, usu roboratis, et tunc redit in idem, ac si synodica foret constitutio. | And if only the pope were to be understood, then it must be understood in accordance with the foregoing, namely, of statutes accepted and strengthened by usage, and then it returns to the same as if it were a synodal constitution. |
| 108 | Ritus enim universalis ecclesiae statutis episcoporum in concilio aequiparatur, 12 di. | For the universal rite of the Church is equated with the statutes of bishops in a council, 12 di. |
| 108 | Omnis. | All. |
| 109 | Non nego tamen papam ad consultationem respondere, persuadere et scribere semper potuisse, sed dico de statutis, quae vim canonum habent, et decretis, quae ligant universaliter in ecclesia. | Yet I do not deny that the pope could always respond to a consultation, persuade, and write, but I say of statutes that have the force of canons, and decrees that bind universally in the Church. |
| 109 | An etiam hodie ex longa consuetudine introducta papa solus universaliter statuere possit, pro nunc non examino. | Whether even today things introduced by long-standing custom can be universally established by the pope alone, I do not examine for now. |
| 109 | Tamen dico: etiam si hoc posset, non est contra propositum nostrum, in quo solum ad hoc tendimus, quod canonum statuendorum auctoritas non solum dependet a papa, sed a communi consensu. | Yet I say: even if this were possible, it is not contrary to our proposition, in which we aim only at this, that the authority to establish canons does not depend solely on the pope, but on common consent. |
| 109 | Et contra hanc conclusionem nulla praescriptio vel consuetudo valere potest, sicut nec contra ius divinum et naturale, a quo ista conclusio dependet. | And against this conclusion no prescription or custom can have force, just as neither can against divine and natural law, from which this conclusion depends. |

| 110 | Unde veneramur introducta per consuetudinem, etiam ubi ignoratur, an cuiusquam principis condendae legis potestatem habentis consensus intervenit. | Therefore, we revere what is introduced by custom, even where it is unknown whether the consent of any law-making authority intervened. |
| 110 | Ac etiam si vis consuetudinis etiam a tacito permissivo consensu superioris partim dependeret, sicut in multis legitime praescriptis consuetudinibus, etiam particularibus, contra generales etiam praeceptivas humanas leges, – dici non oportet – tamen adhuc principium vigoris ortum capit ab usu nullo praecedente consensu. | And even if the force of custom partly depended on the tacit permissive consent of a superior, as in many legitimate customary prescriptions, even particular ones, against general and even preceptive human laws, – it is not necessary to say – still the principle of strength originates from usage without preceding consent. |
| 110 | Immo in potestate etiam patriarcharum videmus sacrum Nicaenum concilium ex moribus arguisse, 65 di. | Indeed, we see that the holy Nicene council argued from the customs of patriarchs, 65 di. |

| 110 | Quoniam mos, dicens: «Parilis mos est ecclesiae Romanae, scilicet sicut Romanus pontifex habet omnium suorum episcoporum potestatem, ita et Alexandrinus ex more habeat per Aegyptum. | For custom says: "The custom of the Roman Church is equal, that is, just as the Roman pontiff has power over all his bishops, so too the Alexandrian one should have it over Egypt by custom. |
| 110 | » Consuetudo enim attendi in patriarcharum potestate iubetur, 9 q. | For custom is to be observed in the power of patriarchs, 9 q. |
| 110 | 3 Conquestus. | 3 Complaints. |
| 110 | Et videmus, quantum Romanus pontifex ultra sacras antiquas observationes ex usu et consuetudine subiectionalis oboedientiae hodie acquisivit. | And we see how much the Roman pontiff has acquired beyond sacred ancient observances from usage and subordinated obedience today. |
| 111 | Habetur breviter ex praescriptis una conclusio intenti ex practica subscriptionum ac etiam rationabiliter probata, scilicet in conciliis Romanum pontificem in condendis statutis generalibus eam non habere potestatem, quam quidam adulatores eidem contribuunt, scilicet quod ipse tantum statuere habeat aliis consulentibus, sed quod non distat praesidentia Romani pontificis quoad hunc effectum in generali vel universali concilio a praesidentia metropolitani in provinciali. | Briefly, from the above, one conclusion is drawn from the practice of subscriptions and also reasonably proven, namely, in councils the Roman pontiff does not have the power in making general statutes that some flatterers attribute to him, namely, that he alone may establish them with others consulting, but that the presidency of the Roman pontiff in this regard in a general or universal council does not differ from that of a metropolitan in a provincial council. |
| 111 | Immo in universali concilio totius universalis catholicae ecclesiae haec praesidentia minor est quoad auctoritatem agendorum quam in patriarchali; in patriarchali vero metropolitano in provinciali recte comparatur et aequiparatur iuxta praehabita. | Indeed, in a universal council of the whole universal Catholic Church, this presidency is less in terms of authority to act than in a patriarchal council; in a patriarchal council, however, the metropolitan's presidency in a provincial council is rightly compared and equated according to the foregoing. |
| 111 | Quare apud antiquos frequenter Romanus pontifex archiepiscopus nominatur. | Therefore, among the ancients the Roman pontiff was often called an archbishop. |
| 111 | In universali autem universalis ecclesiae praesidentiae Romano pontifici non tantum attribuitur sicut eidem in patriarchali aut metropolitano in provinciali secundum ea quae inferius dicentur. | In the universal presidency of the universal Church, the Roman pontiff is not only attributed the same as in a patriarchal or metropolitan in a provincial council, according to what is said below. |

| 112 | Videbitur fortasse aliquibus novum istud, qui legerunt scripta Romanorum pontificum, quomodo plenitudo potestatis sit apud Romanum pontificem, et quod alii omnes vocati sint in partem sollicitudinis, De usu pallii Ad honorem, et quod Gelasius, Silvester et Nicolaus ac Symmachus et alii Romani pontifices dicunt, quomodo papa de omnibus ecclesiis iudicet et de eo nullus, et cum potestas papae sit divina, a deo sibi tradita per verba: «Quodcumque ligaveris», ut notat Franciscus <de> Zab<a>rellis De constitutionibus Cum omnes, et eapropter ut vicarius Christi praesidet ecclesiae universali, De translatione c. | Perhaps some will find this new, who have read the writings of the Roman pontiffs, how the fullness of power is in the Roman pontiff, and that all others are called to the part of solicitude, On the Use of the Pallium For Honor, and that Gelasius, Silvester, and Nicholas and Symmachus and other Roman pontiffs say, how the pope judges all churches and no one else, and since the power of the pope is divine, given to him by God through the words: "Whatsoever you bind," as noted by Francis de Zabarella In Constitutiones Cum omnes, and therefore, as vicar of Christ, he presides over the universal Church, On the Translation c. |
| 112 | 1 et 2, et cum ipse summam illam habeat potestatem et etiam reperiatur subditos quorumcumque episcoporum absque negligentia episcopi proprii et iudicasse et absolvisse et ad eum sine medio appelletur. | 1 and 2, and since he holds that highest power and is also found to have judged and absolved any bishops' subordinates without the negligence of their own bishop and appeals are made to him without an intermediary. |
| 112 | Dicit enim Damasus papa in epistula ad Stephanum, archiepiscopum concilii Mauritaniae, et universis episcopis Africanae provinciae in epistula quae incipit: Lectis fraternitatis vestrae litteris, super ecclesiam universalem papam habere episcopale ministerium et Romanam ecclesiam verticem ecclesiarum, et quod vice Petri legatione pro Christo utitur quisque Romanus pontifex, et quod in metropolitano concilio de omnium concordia causae tractari debent omnium, sed diffinire «summas querelas causarum vel dampnare episcopos absque apostolicae sedis auctoritate minime licet, quam omnes appellare, si necesse fuerit, et eius fulciri auxilio oportet. | For Damasus the pope says in a letter to Stephen, archbishop of the council of Mauretania, and to all bishops of the African province in a letter which begins: "Having read the letters of your fraternity, that the pope has the episcopal ministry over the universal Church and that the Roman Church is the head of churches, and that whoever is a Roman pontiff uses the legation of Peter on behalf of Christ, and that in a metropolitan council all matters must be discussed with the concord of all, but to define 'the highest causes of cases or to condemn bishops without the authority of the apostolic see is by no means allowed, and all must appeal to it if necessary, and must be supported by its aid." |
| 112 | Nam synodum sine eius auctoritate fieri non est catholicum, nec episcopus nisi in synodo legitima et suo tempore apostolica auctoritate congregata diffinite dampnari potest, nec ulla umquam concilia rata leguntur, quae non sunt fulta apostolica auctoritate». | For a synod without its authority is not Catholic, nor can a bishop be condemned except in a legitimate synod and at its proper time convened by apostolic authority, nor is any council ever read as valid which is not supported by apostolic authority." |
| 112 | Haec ille. | That one. |
| 113 | Et talia et consimilia per multos Romanos pontifices habentur, et quia potestas statuendi dependeat a potestate iurisdictionis, ut notat Cardinalis in dicto c. | And such and similar things are found in many Roman pontiffs, and since the power to establish depends on the power of jurisdiction, as noted by the Cardinal in the said c. |
| 113 | Cum omnes, tunc absurdum est dicere, quod adhuc aliquid plus ad vigorem cuiuscumque statuti requiratur quam eius voluntas. | Cum omnes, then it is absurd to say that anything more is required for the force of any statute than his will. |
| 113 | Quod enim placet principi, habet legis vigorem. | For what pleases the prince has the force of law. |
| 113 | Insuper non habet dubium dictum doctorum in c. | Furthermore, there is no doubt among the learned in c. |

| 113 | Sed papam esse rectorem naviculae sancti Petri et universalis ecclesiae nemo etiam &ladddubitat. | But that the pope is the rector of the boat of Saint Peter and of the universal Church is doubted by no one, even &ladddubitates. |
| 113 | Quare vigor constitutionum ab eo dependet, cum sine rectore universitas&radd statuere nequeat. | Therefore, the force of constitutions depends on him, since without a rector a university cannot establish anything. |
| 114 | Talia et consimilia possent per allegationes longas adduci, sed breviter tangendo sufficit, quia cuncta ad ista fundamenta reducuntur, quae contradici possunt, et maxime ex istis Gelasius papa et ex gestis in epistula ad universos episcopos per Dardaniam concludit quod apostolica sedes sine ulla synodo more maiorum absolvit inique a synodo dampnatos. | Such and similar things could be cited at length, but briefly touching on them suffices, since all reduce to these foundations, which can be contradicted, and especially from these Pope Gelasius and from the acts in the letter to all bishops through Dardania concludes that the apostolic see, without any synod, absolves those unjustly condemned by a synod. |
| 114 | Et similiter sine synodo habuit, quos oportuit, dampnandi potestatem. | And similarly, without a synod, it had the power to condemn whom it was necessary to condemn. |
| 114 | Tamen, – antequam procedam – de dampnatione loquebatur Acatii haeretici et fundat se papa in dampnatione generalis synodi, quae haeresim dampnavit, in quam Acatius incidit, ac si papa fateretur Acatium a sede apostolica absque synodo non fuisse dampnatum, nisi in sententiam dampnationis synodi haeresim, in quam incidit, dampnantis incidisset, ac si apostolica sedes exsecuta fuisset prius latam sententiam, 24 q. | Yet, – before proceeding – the matter of condemnation concerned the heretic Acatius, and the pope bases himself on the condemnation of a general synod, which condemned the heresy into which Acatius fell, as if the pope admitted that Acatius was not condemned by the apostolic see without a synod unless he had fallen into the sentence of condemnation of the synod that condemned the heresy into which he fell, as if the apostolic see had executed the sentence before it was issued, 24 q. |

| 115 | Quae ab ecclesiarum, praesertim dominus Franciscus <de> Zab<a>rellis, oporteret primo, si hoc verum foret, Petrum aliquid a Christo singularitatis recepisse et papam in hoc successorem esse. | Which, from the churches, especially Master Francis Zabarellis, it would first be necessary, if this were true, for Peter to have received something singular from Christ and for the pope to be his successor in this. |
| 115 | Sed scimus quod Petrus nihil plus potestatis a Christo recepit aliis apostolis, 21. | But we know that Peter received no more power from Christ than the other apostles, 21. |

| 115 | », ita aliis: «Quaecumque ligaveritis»? | ", and to the others: "Whatever you shall bind"? |
| 115 | Et quamquam Petro dictum est: «Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram etc. | And although it was said to Peter: "You are Peter, and upon this rock etc. |
| 115 | », tamen per petram Christum quem confessus est, intelligimus. | ", yet we understand Christ, whom he confessed, by the rock. |
| 115 | Et si Petrus per petram tamquam lapis fundamenti ecclesiae intelligi deberet, tunc secundum sanctum Hieronymum ita similiter alii apostoli fuerunt lapides fundamenti ecclesiae. | And if Peter were to be understood by the rock as the foundation stone of the Church, then, according to Saint Jerome, the other apostles were similarly foundation stones of the Church. |
| 115 | De quibus habetur Apocalypsis paenultimo, ubi per 12 lapides fundamenti civitatis Hierusalem sanctae ecclesiae nemo dubitat apostolos intelligi debere. | Concerning whom it is found in the penultimate chapter of the Apocalypse, where by the twelve foundation stones of the city of the holy Jerusalem, no one doubts that the apostles are to be understood. |
| 115 | Et si Petro dictum est: «Pasce oves», tamen manifestum est quod illa pascentia est verbo et exemplo; ita etiam, secundum sanctum Augustinum in glossa super eodem verbo, omnibus idem praeceptum est ibi: «Euntes in universum mundum» Matthaei et Marci ultimo. | And if it was said to Peter: "Feed my sheep," yet it is manifest that this feeding is by word and example; so also, according to Saint Augustine in the gloss on the same word, the same precept is given to all there: "Going into all the world" Matthew and Mark, the last chapter. |
| 115 | Nihil reperitur Petro aliud dictum, quod potestatem aliquam importet. | Nothing else is found to have been said to Peter which implies any power. |

| 116 | Quod quidem exercitium exsecutivum sub certis positivis terminis clauditur et restringitur propter melius et cum maiori pace perducendi omnes homines ad finem suum, scilicet deum, ob quem finem finaliter omnis potestas et iurisdictio et statuta humana per media proportionata tempori et loco tendere debent. | Which indeed executive exercise is enclosed and restricted under certain positive terms for the better and with greater peace of leading all men to their end, namely God, for whose sake finally all power and jurisdiction and human statutes ought to tend by means of proportionate to time and place. |
| 116 | Unde cessante causa statuti illius, quae habet distinctionem terminorum, et quod nullus alterius terminos ingrediatur, puta vel ob negligentiam inferiorum vel necessitatem, tunc cessant illa positiva iura. | Whence, the cause of that statute ceasing, which has a distinction of terms, and that no one should enter the terms of another, for instance either through the negligence of inferiors or necessity, then those positive laws cease. |
| 116 | Et hoc videmus: sumus extra humana positiva iura in naturali scilicet iure tempore necessitatis, quoniam tunc omnis sacerdos a quocumque delicto etiam a papa excommunicatum et qualemcumque absolvit. | And this we see: we are outside human positive laws in natural law, namely in time of necessity, because then every priest absolves from any crime, even one excommunicated by the pope, and of whatever kind. |
| 116 | Unde administratio necessario partim erit de iure positivo quoad gradus maioritatis et minoritatis. | Whence administration will necessarily be partly of positive law as regards degrees of majority and minority. |

| 117 | Non nego tamen divinam potestatem concurrere auctorizantem et confirmantem, ut ibidem notatur et certo loco inferius, praesertim in fine huius partis tangitur. | I do not deny, however, that divine power concurs, authorizing and confirming, as is noted there and certainly in a place below, especially at the end of this part it is touched upon. |
| 117 | Ex quibus patet iurisdictionem in Romano pontifice ita constitui ex divino privilegio et electione, sicut in aliis administrationem ecclesiasticam habentibus. | From which it is clear that jurisdiction in the Roman Pontiff is thus constituted from divine privilege and election, just as in others having ecclesiastical administration. |
| 117 | Et sicut gradualis maioritas principatus etiam eodem modo constituitur ex divina ordinatione et electione sive consensu subiectorum, ut dicit textus In novo allegatus Petrum apostolis volentibus a Christo principem constitutum, sic et in aliis administrationem habentibus. | And just as gradual majority of principality is constituted in the same way from divine ordination and election or consent of subjects, as the text says In novo, Peter being constituted prince by Christ with the apostles willing, so also in others having administration. |

| 118 | Verum licet Romanus pontifex principaliter successor sit sancti Petri, tamen non possumus negare omnes episcopos esse eiusdem successores. | But although the Roman Pontiff is principally the successor of Saint Peter, yet we cannot deny that all bishops are his successors. |

| 118 | Et sicut principatus Petri a legatione Christi dependebat, ita et omnium episcoporum, ut dicit Anacletus in eodem c. | And just as Peter's principality depended on Christ's legation, so also that of all bishops, as Anacletus says in the same c. |
| 118 | In novo: «Quare qui eos audit, Christum audit». | In novo: "Wherefore he who hears them hears Christ." |
| 118 | Et non dicit: «Qui eos audit, papam vel Petrum audit». | And he does not say: "He who hears them hears the pope or Peter." |
| 118 | Immo apostolicum praeceptum habent omnes episcopi regendi se et gregem, in quo spiritus sanctus eos posuit ad regendum ecclesiam, et ex illo iudicium synodi ipsis creditum est, quia principes et rectores ecclesiae. | Nay, all bishops have the apostolic precept of governing themselves and the flock, in which the Holy Spirit placed them to govern the Church, and from that the judgment of the synod was entrusted to them, because they are princes and rulers of the Church. |
| 118 | Quod etiam principes, qui inter episcopos eliguntur ad archiepiscopatum vel primatum, sint Petri successores, patet per hoc, quod dicit idem Anacletus in epistula ad omnes episcopos et sacerdotes quae incipit: Benedictus Deus. | That also princes, who are chosen among bishops to the archbishopric or primacy, are successors of Peter, is clear from this, which the same Anacletus says in the letter to all bishops and priests which begins: Benedictus Deus. |
| 118 | Dicit: «Beati apostoli inter se statuerunt, ut episcopi singularium gentium scirent, quis inter eos primus esset, quatenus ad eum potior eorum sollicitudo pertineret. | He says: "The blessed apostles determined among themselves that the bishops of individual nations should know who among them was first, so that the greater solicitude of them should pertain to him. |
| 118 | Nam et inter apostolos quaedam fuit discretio, et licet omnes essent apostoli, Petro tamen concessum est a domino, et ipsi inter se id ipsum voluerunt, ut reliquis omnibus praeesset apostolis et Cephas, id est caput, et principium teneret apostolatus. | For there was also some distinction among the apostles, and although all were apostles, yet it was granted to Peter by the Lord, and they themselves among themselves wished the same, that he should preside over all the other apostles and hold Cephas, that is, the head and beginning of the apostleship. |
| 118 | Qui et eandem formam successoribus suis et reliquis episcopis tenendam tradiderunt». | Which he also handed down to be held by his successors and the other bishops." |
| 118 | Haec ille; &ladd22 di. | Thus he; &ladd22 di. |
| 118 | Sacrosancta. | Sacrosancta. |
| 118 | &radd Ecce, quod forma data est per apostolos, quod, sicut ipsi Petrum praetulerunt, ita primas supra alios constitui debet. | &radd Behold, that a form was given by the apostles, that, just as they preferred Peter, so a primate ought to be constituted above others. |
| 118 | Quare primas ita succedit Petro sicut alii episcopi apostolis aliis, et sicut de primate dictum est, ita et de archiepiscopo dici debet, quod ipse est successor sancti Petri. | Wherefore a primate succeeds Peter just as other bishops succeed other apostles, and just as it has been said of the primate, so it ought to be said of the archbishop, that he is the successor of Saint Peter. |
| 119 | Dicunt quidam moderni Petrum apostolos misisse ad particulares provincias volentes ex hoc trahere, quod exercitium potestatis ligandi et solvendi fuit a Christo Petro datum et per Petrum aliis. | Certain moderns claim that Peter the Apostle was sent by Christ to particular provinces, intending to draw from this that the exercise of the power to bind and loose was given by Christ to Peter, and through Peter to others. |
| 119 | Anacletus papa in eadem epistula non ita dicit, sed dicit apostolos a Christo electos et eo iubente dispersos. | Anacletus, the Pope, in the same letter, does not say this, but says that the Apostles were chosen by Christ and dispersed by His command. |
| 119 | Insuper Romani pontifices, praesertim Symmachus papa et alii, scribunt Romanum pontificem a solo deo iudicari. | Moreover, the Roman Popes, especially Symmachus, the Pope, and others, write that the Roman Pope is to be judged only by God. |
| 119 | Nonne idem Anacletus in epistula quae incipit: Quoniam apostolicae, ad episcopos Italiae dicit summos sacerdotes, id est episcopos, a deo iudicari? | Does not the same Anacletus, in the letter that begins: "Since the apostolic, to the bishops of Italy, says that the highest priests, that is, the bishops, are to be judged by God?" |
| 119 | Et idem Pius papa, 6 q. | The same Pius, the Pope, ... |
| 119 | 1 Oves. | 1 John |
| 119 | Unde qualem intellectum hoc habet de papa, scilicet quod a subiectis iudicari non possit, talem et aliud de episcopis. | What understanding this has of the Pope, namely that he cannot be judged by his subjects, is the same and different for bishops. |
| 119 | Similiter si textus dicit papam habere plenitudinem potestatis et alios in partem sollicitudinis vocatos, ita etiam possumus de quolibet archiepiscopo patriarchave dicere, ut dicit § 19 q. | Similarly, if the text says that the Pope has the fullness of power and others are called to share in the care, the same can also be said about any archbishop or patriarch, as is said in § 19 q. 3. |
| 119 | 3. | If you say that the Pope absolves and binds the subjects of bishops, I say the same in other cases, when the consent of the proper ones intervenes. |
| 120 | Si dicis papam subditos episcoporum absolvere et ligare, dico idem in aliis, quando consensus propriorum intervenit. | For no act is valid in this matter by the consent or satisfaction of a proper priest, 9 q. 2 Lugdunensis, c. |
| 120 | Actus enim alias nullus per consensum aut gratificationem proprii sacerdotis in hac materia validus efficitur, 9 q. | Nullum et c. |
| 120 | 2 Lugdunensis, c. | Bishop. |
| 120 | Nullum et c. | Since this is commonly introduced by usage, and the consent is elicited from usage, it is clear that the effectiveness of this derives from the consent. |
| 120 | Episcopum. | Therefore, since no one is obliged to obey except in what has been granted by the canon, 18 q. 2. |
| 120 | Cum ergo usu communi sit hoc introductum et ex usu consensus elicitur, patet quod efficacia huius vigorem ex consensu recipit. | Only this, 9 q. 3 Conquestus, and since no such canon is found in any council's papal appeal, it must be resolved by custom, usage, and consent. |
| 120 | Unde cum nullus teneatur oboedire nisi in concessis a canone, 18 q. | The Pope does not have, by canon, the power to harm the jurisdiction of bishops, because he would be disturbing the order, 11 q. 1. |
| 120 | 2 Hoc tantum, 9 q. | It has thus reached the end, etc. |
| 120 | 3 Conquestus, et cum non reperiatur canon alicuius concilii papam hoc posse appellatione nulla interposita, oportet ad consuetudinem, usum et consensum istud resolvere. | The ancient Roman Popes did not claim to have intervened in these matters and granted such concessions; and perhaps it would not have been permitted. |
| 120 | Papa enim non habet ex canone, quod laedere posset iurisdictionem episcoporum, quia esset ordinem turbare, 11 q. | If the African Council, to which Saint Augustine subscribed, did not admit the appeal to the Pope from the synod, because this was not found in the canons, but in the Nicene Council it was defined that the cause should be terminated in the synod where it arose, as is recorded in 6 q. 4. |
| 120 | 1 Pervenit in fine igitur etc. | If a bishop acts criminally, as is read in the same council's letter to Pope Zosimus, similarly, he [the bishop] should be subject to the same text 2 q. 6. |
| 121 | Non legitur antiquos Romanos pontifices se de hiis intromisisse et talia confessionalia et alia consimilia concessisse; et forte non fuisset permissum. | If the bishop who is attributed to the Council of Sardica, which can be called and should be sent as the Pope's legate to the province, as is clear from the same letter and the letter to Pope Boniface written by the same council, did not want to admit it, indeed, they say they have never found it in any council, although Faustinus, the legate of the Apostolic See, said that he was present at the Council of Nicaea, and in the cited passage it is said that the Council of Sardica was present, how then did they admit these things and what is done excessively today? |
| 121 | Unde si concilium Africanum, cui se subscripsit sanctus Augustinus, non admisit appellationem a synodo ad papam, quia non inveniebatur in canonibus hoc concessum, sed in Nicaena synodo diffinitum causam terminari debere in synodo, ubi orta fuit, ut habetur 6 q. | But because long-standing usage has now introduced this by consensus, these are valid as far as the salvation of souls is concerned, as long as they are endured. |
| 121 | 4 Si quis episcopus criminaliter, ut haec leguntur in epistula eiusdem concilii ad Zosimum papam, similiter illi textum 2 q. | They can be removed by a council, and this reform demands it. |
| 121 | 6 Si episcopus, qui ascribitur concilio Sardicensi, quod appellari possit et legatus papae ad provinciam mitti deberet, ut patet ex eadem epistula et epistula ad Bonifatium papam per idem concilium scripta, noluerunt admittere, immo dicunt se in nullo concilio repperisse, licet Faustinus, legatus apostolicae sedis, concilii Nicaeni esse dixerit et in allegato loco dicatur Sardicensis concilii fore, quomodo tunc admisissent ista et ea, quae hodie exorbitanter fiunt? | If you say more about the dispensatory power of the Pope in the canons, arguing power to establish from this, you conclude nothing, because even a bishop and a presbyter dispense in the penitential canons, 27 q. |
| 121 | Sed quia consensus ex usu longaevo hoc nunc introduxit, valida illa sunt quoad animarum salutem, quamdiu patiuntur. | Tempora poenitentiae, and a bishop in other penalties, 50 di. |
| 121 | Tolli autem possent per concilium, et hoc reformatio deposcit. | If a presbyter, 1 q. 5 § ultimo, 9 q. 2 Lugdunensis. |
| 122 | Si dicis ultra de potestate dispensativa papae in canonibus ex eo arguendo potestatem statuendi, nihil concludis, quia etiam episcopus et presbyter dispensant in canonibus poenitentialibus, 27 q. | Dispensation does not prejudice the canons, 9 q. 1 Ordinationes et q. 2 Lugdunensis, argumentum c. |
| 122 | 6 Tempora poenitudinis, et episcopus in aliis poenalibus, 50 di. | Priscis 50 di. |
| 122 | Si quis presbyter, 1 q. | Therefore, the argument is not conclusive. |
| 122 | 5 § ultimo, 9 q. | The fact that it is said about the rector does not prevent it, because, if a community could not establish anything without a rector, it does not follow that the rector, without a community in which there is a habit and power, could establish anything. |
| 122 | 2 Lugdunensis. | Nor is it argued from jurisdiction, because power to establish, although it is linked to jurisdiction, does not follow from it. |
| 122 | Nec facit dispensatio canonibus praeiudicium, 9 q. | Not every one who has jurisdiction has the power to establish, but every one who has the power to establish has jurisdiction. |
| 122 | 1 Ordinationes et q. | So we say that every synod of the Fathers, because it has the power to establish, has jurisdiction. |
| 122 | 2 Lugdunensis, argumentum c. | Therefore, since the root of the canons as to the power to bind is shown to exist in consensus, otherwise, unless we validly argue from usage and unless abrogation by non-use could be introduced, there would be no salvation. |
| 122 | Priscis 50 di. | Who can know where our symbol received its addition and change from the symbols of the four councils without anathema, or concerning the certain sacraments of the Church, where their introduction was made in the councils, or how we could avoid countless penalties imposed by the canons for excommunication, deposition, and the like, unless in all these cases concord, consensus, usage, and non-usage helped us? |
| 122 | Quare nihil concludit argumentum. | Therefore, in the c. 1 of a certain Council of Toledo, it is said: "If anything in the earlier ones has been neglected, they who neglect the censures of ordination will continue to bear the revived censures, as long as they, who in the councils were decreed but abused by the passage of time, and pertain to the worship of the faith, devote themselves to the religious observance of God's mercy more easily." See, what they lose the censures of ordination, which, with another interpretation, revives. |
| 123 | Nec illud, quod de rectore dicitur, obstat, quia, si sine rectore universitas statuere non posset, exercitio iurisdictionis apud eum exsistente, non tamen sequitur e converso rectorem sine universitate, in qua est habitus et potestas, statuere posse. | Therefore, long-standing customs approved by those using them become law. |
| 123 | Nec ex iurisdictione recte arguitur, quia potestas statuendi, licet alligetur iurisdictioni, non tamen ad eam sequitur. | When the authority fails, the customs and institutions of the people and the elders are to be kept in its place, as is also recorded in 12 di. |
| 123 | Non omnis habens iurisdictionem habet condendi potestatem, sed omnis habens condendi potestatem habet iurisdictionem. | In these matters. |
| 123 | Sic dicimus omnem synodum patrum, quia habet condendi potestatem statuta, habere etiam et iurisdictionem. | In such a consensus, synodal statutes are founded. |
| 124 | Unde quia ex praehabitis patet radicem canonum quoad ligandi vigorem in consensu exsistere, alioquin, nisi ex usu valide argueremus et nisi abrogatio per non-usum introduci posset, non foret salus. | Therefore, Gregory the Pope, in his profession of the four councils, says that, since they were established by universal consent, he and not they destroy anyone who presumes to dissolve what they bind or bind what they loose. |
| 124 | Quis potest scire, unde symbolum nostrum additionem et mutationem a symbolis quattuor conciliorum absque anathemate recepit, aut de sacramentis certis ecclesiae, ubi in conciliis introductio facta sit, aut quomodo evaderemus innumeras poenas latae sententiae in canonibus positas excommunicationis, depositionis et huiusmodi, nisi in hiis omnibus concordia et consensus, usus et non-usus nos iuvarent? | The synod does not only define by the authority of those who are present, but by the universal consent of all, as Gregory says, that what is established by the bishops who are present representing others is also established by universal consent. |
| 124 | Unde in c. | Therefore, at the end of a certain Council of Toledo, it is read: "If anyone presumes to oppose our own and theirs, who now did not attend the holy synod in the province, to this salutary ordinance, or negligently fails to comply with it, let him be considered alienated from the brotherly love for a time." Those who are present are considered to have the authority of all by those who were rightly summoned to the synod by a common legation. |
| 124 | 1 cuiusdam Toletani concilii dicitur: «Si qua in anterioribus sunt neglecta, redivivam ordinationis censuram obtineant, quatenus, dum hiis, quae in conciliis sunt decreta, sed abusione temporum hactenus dimissa, et ad cultum fidei pertinent, studium religiosae observationis impendimus, dei misericordiam facilius impetremus. | This is proven by 8 c. secundi Africani concilii, which is placed below, where it is said that the legates of others grant full authority to the council. |
| 124 | » Ecce, quod neglecta perdunt ordinationis censuram, quae alia acceptatione reviviscit. | " Behold, those who neglect it lose the censure of ordination, which is revived by another acceptance. |
| 124 | Unde diuturni mores consensu utentium approbati legem imitantur, 12 di. | Hence, long-standing customs approved by the consent of users imitate law, 12 di. |
| 124 | Diuturni, et ubi auctoritas deficit, mos populi et maiorum instituta pro lege sunt servanda, eadem di. | Long-standing, and where authority is lacking, the custom of the people and the institutions of ancestors are to be observed as law, the same di. |
| 124 | In hiis. | In these. |
| 124 | In tali etenim consensu fundantur synodalia statuta. | For in such consent synodal statutes are founded. |
| 124 | Unde Gregorius papa in professione quattuor conciliorum dicit, quia, dum universali consensu sunt constituta, se et non illa destruit, quisquis praesumit aut solvere, quos ligant, aut ligare, quos solvunt. | Hence Pope Gregory in the profession of the four councils says that, since they were established by universal consent, whoever presumes either to loosen what they bind, or to bind what they loosen, destroys himself and not them. |
| 124 | Synodus enim non solum auctoritate eorum qui sunt praesentes diffinit, sed omnium, ut dicit Gregorius universali consensu ea esse statuta, quae per episcopos, qui praesentes sunt alios repraesentantes, statuuntur. | For a synod is defined not only by the authority of those who are present, but of all, as Gregory says that those things are established by universal consent which are established by bishops who are present representing others. |
| 124 | Unde in fine cuiusdam Toletani concilii legitur: «Si quis autem tam nostrum quam eorum, qui nunc sanctae synodo ex provincia defuerunt, huic tam salubri ordinationi obviare praesumpserit vel sollerter adimplere neglexerit, convictus totius fraternae caritatis habeatur aliquamdiu extraneus. | Hence at the end of a certain Toletan council it is read: "But if anyone should presume to oppose this most salutary ordinance, or should neglect to diligently fulfill it, both of our own and of those who are now absent from the holy synod from the province, let him be considered an outsider for some time, convicted of lacking all brotherly charity. |
| 124 | » Censentur enim illi praesentes aliis rite ad synodum spectantibus convocatis communi legatione omnium auctoritatem habere ex praemissis. | " For those present, with others rightly summoned to the synod by a common delegation, are considered to have the authority of all from the foregoing. |
| 124 | Et probantur haec ex 8 c. | And these things are proven from 8 c. |
| 124 | secundi Africani concilii infra ponendo, ubi habetur quod legati aliorum nomine plenam tribuunt concilio auctoritatem. | of the second African council, set forth below, where it is held that legates give full authority to the council in the name of others. |
| 125 | Et haec pars non habet dubium concilia tam universalia totius ecclesiae quam universalia regnorum Hispaniarum, Galliarum vel Africae tam unius provinciae semper potuisse sibi ipsis canones statuere, sicut Bonifatius ad Rusticum Narbonensem scribens dicit patres in Nicaea congregatos sibimet canones statuisse, hoc est toti mundo seu universali ecclesiae, quam ipsi ibi repraesentabant. | And this part does not doubt that both universal councils of the entire Church and universal councils of the kingdoms of Spain, Gaul, or Africa have always been able to establish canons for themselves, just as Boniface, writing to Rusticus of Narbonne, says that the fathers gathered at Nicaea established canons for themselves, that is, for the whole world or the universal Church, which they represented there. |
| 125 | Legitur enim in gestis concilii nono anno Constantini tertii Romae praesidente Martino papa et 105 episcopis celebrato in principio Martinum papam de Leone papa, et quomodo per synodum Calcedonensem eius scriptum approbatum foret, dixisse: «Sancta Calcedonensis synodus diffinivit, hoc est dicere omnium sanctorum chorus. | For it is read in the acts of the council held in the ninth year of Constantine, with Pope Martin presiding at Rome and 105 bishops attending, at the beginning, that Pope Martin said about Pope Leo: "The holy synod of Chalcedon defined it, that is to say, the chorus of all the saints." |
| 125 | Quoniam quod una sanctorum patrum synodus iudicare videtur, tam omnes synodi quam universi omnino confirmare patres noscuntur, utpote in uno eodemque verbo fidei sibi vicissim per indissolubilem consonantiam concordantes. | Since what one synod of the holy fathers seems to judge, all synods and absolutely all the fathers are known to confirm, as being in agreement with one another in the same word of faith through an indissoluble consonance. |
| 125 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 125 | Et sicut synodus provincialis collecta sibi providet de canonibus per provinciam necessariis, ita si septem Galliarum provinciae convenirent, possent septem provinciis providere. | And just as a provincial synod gathered provides for itself about the canons necessary for the province, so if seven provinces of Gaul were to convene, they could provide for the seven provinces. |
| 125 | Et si omnes mundi provinciae convenirent, sicut tunc quaelibet potest sibi providere, possunt per communem concordiam omnes omnibus providere. | And if all the provinces of the world were to convene, just as any one of them can provide for itself, they can provide for all of them through common agreement. |
| 125 | Et mirum est dicere non posse omnes congregatos cum plena auctoritate legatorum, quod quaelibet per se posset. | And it is wonderful to say that all gathered with full authority of their legates cannot do what any one of them could do by itself. |
| 125 | Quaelibet autem per se sine papa, non dubium, sibi providere potest, ergo et omnes eo regulariter non spreto volenti et potenti interesse Romano pontifice ac alio ad synodum spectante, cum tamen maioris sit auctoritatis synodus plurium provinciarum quam unius, ut in capitulo sequenti dicetur. | However, any one of them can provide for itself without the pope, no doubt; therefore, all of them, with the Roman pontiff not spurned but willing and able to attend, and another attending the synod, since a synod of several provinces has greater authority than one of a single province, as will be said in the following chapter. |
| 126 | Et dum hanc partem defendimus, quod papa non est universalis episcopus, sed super alios primus, et sic sacrorum conciliorum non in papa, sed in consensu omnium vigorem fundamus, tunc, quia veritatem defendimus et unicuique suum honorem reservamus, recte papam honoramus, 99 di. | And while we defend this part, that the pope is not a universal bishop but the first among others, and thus we base the vigor of sacred councils not in the pope but in the consensus of all, then, because we defend the truth and reserve honor to each one, we rightly honor the pope. |
| 126 | c. | c. |

| 127 | Ad haec, ut melius quisque contentetur, annecto aliam considerationem quae, licet diffusius desideraret explicari: brevitati studens ac legenti complacere succincte perstringam eandem. | To these things, so that anyone may be more satisfied, I add another consideration which, although it may desire a more diffuse explanation, I will briefly summarize for the sake of brevity and to please the reader. |
| 127 | Omnis constitutio radicatur in iure naturali, et si ei contradicit, constitutio valida esse nequit, 9 di. | Every constitution is rooted in natural law, and if it contradicts it, the constitution cannot be valid. |
| 127 | Cum ergo et c. | Since therefore and c. |
| 127 | Constitutiones. | Constitutions. |
| 127 | Unde cum ius naturale naturaliter rationi insit, tunc connata est omnis lex homini in radice sua. | Hence, since natural law is naturally inherent in reason, every law is born in its root in man. |
| 127 | Ideo sapientiores et praestantiores aliis rectores eliguntur, ut ipsi in sua naturali clara ratione sapientia et prudentia praedita iustas leges eliciant et per eas alios regant et causas discutiant, ut pax servetur, sicut sunt Responsa prudentum, 2 di. | Therefore, wiser and more excellent rulers are chosen than others, so that they, endowed with wisdom and prudence in their clear natural reason, may elicit just laws and govern others through them and discuss causes, so that peace may be preserved, as are the Responses of prudent men. |
| 127 | Ex quo evenit quod ratione vigentes sunt naturaliter aliorum domini et rectores, sed non per legem coercivam aut iudicium, quod redditur in invitum. | From this it happens that those who are vigorous in reason are naturally lords and rulers of others, but not through coercive law or judgment that is rendered against one's will. |
| 127 | Unde cum natura omnes sint liberi, tunc omnis principatus, sive consistat in lege scripta sive viva apud principem, per quem principatum coercentur a malis subditi et eorum regulatur libertas ad bonum metu poenarum, est a sola concordantia et consensu subiectivo. | Hence, since all are free by nature, every principality, whether it consists in written law or in living law in the prince, through which principality subjects are coerced from evil and their liberty is regulated to good through fear of penalties, is from the sole concordance and subjective consent. |
| 127 | Nam si natura aeque potentes et aeque liberi homines sunt, vera et ordinata potestas unius communis aeque potentis naturaliter non nisi electione et consensu aliorum constitui potest, sicut etiam lex ex consensu constituitur, 2 di. | For if by nature men are equally powerful and equally free, the true and ordered power of one common equal in power cannot be constituted except by election and consent of others, just as law is constituted from consent. |
| 127 | Lex, 8 di. | Law. |
| 127 | Quae contra, ubi dicit: «Pactum inter se gentis aut civitatis» etc. | Which is against, where it says: "A pact among themselves of a nation or city," etc. |
| 127 | «Generale pactum societatis humanae est obtemperare regibus suis etc. | "The general pact of human society is to obey their kings," etc. |
| 127 | » Ecce, quia pacto generali convenit humana societas velle regibus oboedire, tunc, quia in vero regiminis ordine ipsius rectoris electio fieri debet, per quam electionem constituatur rector iudex eligentium, tunc ordinata et recta dominia et praesidentiae per electionem constituuntur, et etiam sic constituti iudices sunt generales eligentium, ut secundum Hostiensem in Summa et alios doctores hoc alibi notavi. | Behold, because by general pact human society agrees to obey kings, then, because in the true order of government the election of the ruler himself ought to be made, through which election the ruler is constituted as judge of those electing, then ordered and right dominion and presidency are constituted by election, and even thus constituted judges are general judges of those electing. |
| 128 | Et quia sunt generales illi iudices, ab ipsis usque ad summum appellationes interponi possunt, quia singulariter in qualibet causa diffinitores ex consensu specifico electi non sunt. | And because those judges are general, appeals can be made to them, because they were not elected as definitive judges in any particular cause through specific consent. |
| 128 | Sed si in particulari causa electi a partibus forent, tunc appellare non liceret regulariter, ut habet 10 canon Africani concilii: «Sane si ex consensu partium iudices electi fuerint, etiam a pauciori numero quam constitutum est, non liceat provocari», et habetur 2 q. | But if in a particular cause judges were elected by the parties, then it would not be lawful to appeal, as the 10th canon of the African council has: "Certainly, if judges are elected by the consent of the parties, even by a smaller number than is constituted, it is not lawful to appeal." |
| 128 | 6. | 6. |
| 128 | Iudex iuste iudicare debet, quare ipso iure sententia est nulla, si contra leges vel canones promulgatur, De sententia et re iudicata c. | A judge ought to judge justly, therefore by the same law a sentence is null if it is promulgated against laws or canons. |
| 128 | 1 cum concordantiis ibi allegatis in glossa. | 1 with concordances alleged there in the gloss. |
| 129 | Nec etiam apostolicam sedem legitur umquam contra canones iudicasse, ut in epistula Bonifatii papae ad Zachariam, in ea epistula, cuius initium est Confitemur, et in multis allegationibus infra positis. | Nor is it read that the apostolic see has ever judged against the canons, as in the letter of Pope Boniface to Zacharias, in that letter, whose beginning is Confitemur, and in many allegations placed below. |
| 129 | Immo iudicium ipsius per concilium plenarium iterum examinatur, ut inferius ex gestis et auctoritate Augustini declaratur. | Indeed, its judgment is examined again by a plenary council, as will be declared below from the acts and authority of Augustine. |
| 129 | In vanum autem examinaretur, si omne id ius esset, quod pontifex Romanus vellet, quia tunc iniuste sententiare nequiret. | But in vain it would be examined if all that law were what the Roman pontiff wished, because then he could not sentence unjustly. |
| 129 | Quare oportet quod eius iudicium canonibus stringatur quibus subest, et per quos examinatur sententia, an secundum eos sit iusta velne. | Therefore, it is necessary that his judgment be bound by the canons to which he is subject and by which his sentence is examined, whether it is just according to them or not. |
| 130 | Praeterea canones radices habent in naturali iure, contra quod etiam princeps potestatem non habet, igitur nec contra canonem in eo fundatum et accessorie ad ius naturale sequentem. | Moreover, canons have their roots in natural law, against which even a prince does not have power, therefore not against a canon founded in it and following accessory to natural law. |
| 130 | Et quia hoc ita est, quomodo debemus dicere in potestate iudicis esse condere canones et statuta? | And because this is so, how ought we to say that it is in the power of a judge to establish canons and statutes? |
| 130 | Quoniam, si hoc ita foret, non posset iudex, si canonum condendorum potestatem per se haberet, umquam argui de iniusta sententia, sententia enim ius foret: ergo semper iusta. | For if this were so, a judge could never be accused of an unjust sentence if he had the power of establishing canons by himself, for his sentence would be law: therefore always just. |
| 130 | Sed quia lex debet esse rationabilis, possibilis, consuetudini patriae non adversans, 4 di. | But because law ought to be reasonable, possible, not contrary to the custom of the country. |
| 130 | Erit autem, non possumus legem dicere non acceptam usu utentium etiam in quocumque foro civili vel canonico, eadem di. | It will be, we cannot say that law is not accepted by the usage of those using it even in any civil or canonical forum. |
| 130 | Leges et capitulis sequentibus. | Laws and following chapters. |
| 130 | Quare si usus requiritur approbatorius legum, ut dicit c. | Therefore, if approved usage is required for laws, as the chapter says. |
| 130 | Leges, non possumus ex nova lege reum iuste condempnare, quia peccare in eam non potuit quae nondum fuit. | Laws, we cannot justly condemn someone under a new law, because he could not sin against it which was not yet in existence. |
| 130 | Oportet itaque quod in approbatam legem per mores et usum acceptam deliquerit. | It is necessary, therefore, that he has offended against an approved law accepted by customs and usage. |
| 130 | Unde ex hoc clare patet legem et canonem esse regulam omnis iudicantis, et quod omnis lex sive canon supra quemcumque iudicem iudicantem exsistit. | Hence, it clearly appears that law and canon are the rule of every judge, and that every law or canon exists above any judge judging. |
| 131 | Tunc ulterius, si canon ex concordantia, usu et acceptatione approbatur, tunc firmitas cuiusque constitutionis ex acceptatione est. | Then further, if a canon is approved by concordance, usage, and acceptance, then the firmness of any constitution is from acceptance. |
| 131 | Quare ex concilio communi recte ecclesiastici canones dicuntur. | Therefore, ecclesiastical canons are rightly said to be from a common council. |
| 131 | Ecclesia enim congregatio est. | For the Church is a congregation. |
| 131 | Non potest unus recte ecclesiasticos canones edere. | One cannot rightly edict ecclesiastical canons. |
| 131 | Unde evenit quod videmus in conciliis canones ex concordi acceptatione, consensu et subscriptione editos, decretales autem aut decisiones iudiciales Romanorum pontificum aut dubiorum in emergentibus non ex voluntate pura potestativa robur firmitatis et iustitiae recepisse, sed quia secundum canones ita convenit easdem decisiones fieri quae sunt notanda. | Hence, it happens that we see canons in councils edicted by concordant acceptance, consent, and subscription, but decrees or judicial decisions of Roman pontiffs or of doubtful emerging cases have not received the vigor of firmness and justice from pure will and power, but because according to the canons it is fitting that these decisions be made which are to be noted. |
| 131 | Ita intelligo 15 di. | Thus I understand the 15th distinction. |
| 131 | Sancta Romana § Item decretales et 19 di. | The holy Roman [church] § Item decrees and the 19th distinction. |
| 131 | In canonicis cum consimilibus, et de hoc etiam alibi diffusius, praesertim in fine huius secundae partis ac in principio tertiae et in fine eiusdem. | In canonical matters with similar ones, and about this also elsewhere more diffusely, especially at the end of this second part and at the beginning of the third and at the end of it. |
| 132 | Capitulum XV. | Chapter XV. |
| 132 | Iam ex praehabitis constat omnium constitutionum ligandi vigorem consistere in concordia et consensu tacito vel expresso, qui ex usu aut eorum, qui ceteros legatione quadam aut praesidentia in potestate habent, dictamine. | It is now clear from the preceding that the binding force of all constitutions rests on concord and consent, whether tacit or expressed, derived from the practice or decree of those who hold others in some sort of delegation or authority. |
| 132 | Sicut enim episcopus cum capitulo ecclesiam dioecesanam facere dicitur, quia alios omnes illa collectio in potentia habet, qui de eadem ecclesia sunt, quare reputantur cuncti in istis, sic et metropolita cum suffraganeis ecclesiam provincialem constituit et patriarcha cum metropolitanis patriarchalem. | Just as a bishop, with the chapter, is said to constitute the diocesan church, because that assembly has in its power all others who belong to the same church, and thus all are reckoned among them, so too a metropolitan with his suffragans constitutes the provincial church, and a patriarch with his metropolitans the patriarchal one. |
| 132 | Unde cuiuslibet collectionis auctoritas extendit se per omnes in ipsa collectione repraesentativa in potentia exsistentes, Romanam autem ecclesiam dicimus ex papa et metropolitanis adiunctis constitui secundum antiquas observantias, quia illi annue ad ipsum patriarchale caput concurrebant. | Therefore, the authority of any assembly extends to all who are potentially represented within it.  We say that the Roman Church is constituted by the pope and the metropolitans associated with him, according to ancient customs, because they annually convened at the patriarchal head. |
| 132 | Et quia nunc illis metropolitanis ac universali observantia consentiente cardinales de diversis regionibus assumpti legationem ac vicem omnium habent tam in eligendo Romanum pontificem quam consulendo universali Romanae ecclesiae, dicimus recte Romanum pontificem in cunctis universalem Romanam ecclesiam respicientibus sine ipsis nihil facere debere, et si qua fecerit, impune posse non acceptari. | And because now cardinals, chosen from various regions and with the consent of universal observance, hold the delegation and the place of all, both in electing the Roman pontiff and in advising the universal Roman Church, we rightly say that the Roman pontiff ought to do nothing concerning all matters pertaining to the universal Roman Church without them, and if he does, it may be rightfully rejected without penalty. |
| 132 | Verum est quod haec cardinalium taciti consensus universalis Romanae ecclesiae potestas indigeret reformari et ad ordinem expressae legationis reduci, ut de hoc aliquo loco tactum est. | It is true that this tacit consent of the cardinals, the power of the universal Roman Church, needs reform and reduction to the order of explicit delegation, as has been touched upon in some place. |
| 133 | Ex praemissis etiam intellectus huius – quod Romani pontifices saepe allegant, ut Damasus papa in epistula ad Stephanum, archiepiscopum concilii Mauritaniae, et alii Romani pontifices, 17 di. | From the foregoing, the understanding of this—which the Roman pontiffs often allege, as Pope Damasus in his letter to Stephen, archbishop of the council of Mauritania, and other Roman pontiffs, 17th day— |
| 133 | Regula, scilicet nullam ratam synodum, quam ipsius apostolicae sedis non firmat auctoritas – facile haberi potest, quoniam de sede loquitur. | The rule, namely, that no synod is valid unless confirmed by the authority of the Apostolic See, is easily understood, since it speaks of the See. |
| 133 | Et verum est nullum iudicium cuiuscumque synodi, ubi non est auctoritas apostolicae sedis, firmum esse, quia semper appellari potest a iudicio illius synodi ad apostolicam sedem. | And it is true that no judgment of any synod, where there is no authority of the Apostolic See, is firm, because appeal can always be made from the judgment of that synod to the Apostolic See. |
| 133 | Ita de patriarchis Flaviano et Ignatio et aliis Constantinopolitanis et Athanasio Alexandrino et aliis legimus ad apostolicam sedem appellatum. | Thus, we read of Patriarchs Flavian and Ignatius, and others of Constantinople, and Athanasius of Alexandria, and others, having appealed to the Apostolic See. |
| 133 | Unde si synodus aliqua dampnavit quem, etiam patriarcham, illius synodi diffinitio propter appellationem, quae ab ea interponi potest ad apostolicam sedem, absque confirmatione eiusdem sedis rata non est. | Therefore, if any synod has condemned someone, even a patriarch, the decree of that synod, because of the appeal that can be made from it to the Apostolic See, is not valid without the confirmation of that same See. |
| 133 | Et cum dicitur quod absque synodo ipsa sedes apostolica iniuste in synodo dampnatos restituere potest, hoc verum est, absque scilicet universali synodo universalis ecclesiae. | And when it is said that the Apostolic See can justly restore those condemned in a synod without a synod, this is true, namely, without a universal synod of the universal Church. |
| 133 | Quia si in patriarchali synodo aut Constantinopolitano vel Alexandrino aut alio magno provinciali Gallicano vel Hispano quis dampnaretur, apostolica sedes quae, ut saepe dictum est, ex facientibus et repraesentantibus Romanam ecclesiam constituitur modo praetacto, superioritatem continet et de ipsis cognoscere potest synodicis diffinitis. | For if someone were condemned in a patriarchal synod, or a Constantinopolitan or Alexandrian, or another great provincial one of Gaul or Spain, the Apostolic See, which, as has often been said, is constituted by those who act and represent the Roman Church in the manner previously described, contains the superiority and can judge the synodical decrees concerning them. |
| 133 | Ita legimus Nicolaum papam de Ignatio per Photium dampnato in sede apostolica collecta synodice cognovisse, ita Martinum papam de Pyrrho et Sergio et ante illos Iulium papam de causa inter Eusebium et Athanasium Alexandrinum, et ita in omnibus legimus observatum. | Thus, we read that Pope Nicholas, concerning Ignatius condemned by Photius, made a synodical judgment in the Apostolic See; likewise Pope Martin concerning Pyrrhus and Sergius, and before them Pope Julius concerning the case between Eusebius and Athanasius of Alexandria; and thus we read that this has been observed in all cases. |
| 134 | Et haec est vera sententia, scilicet quod sedes apostolica in cognoscendo supereminet omnibus synodis dempta ipsa universali universalis ecclesiae, cuius ipsa sedes pars est. | And this is the true opinion, namely, that the Apostolic See, excluding the universal synod of the universal Church, of which the See itself is a part, is superior in judging all synods. |
| 134 | Quare absque synodo universalis ecclesiae de diffinitis omnium synodorum inferiorum cognoscit. | Therefore, without a universal synod of the universal Church, it judges the decrees of all inferior synods. |
| 134 | Unde, ut legitur in sexta actione octavi concilii in responsionibus, quas Metrophanes, episcopus Smyrnae, ad argumenta Zachariae Calcedonensis de Appiario restituto per ecclesiam Romanam contra sententiam Africani concilii <dedit>, scilicet quod ipsa non fuisset accepta in Africa, tunc sententia Zosimi papae in synodo de absolutione Appiarii prius in synodo Africana dampnati fuit demum admissa, licet ipse ad eandem suam ecclesiam primam propter scandalum non fuisset admissus, sed datae sibi a synodo fuere litterae commendatitiae, quod in omnibus aliis ecclesiis sacerdotio fungi posset. | Therefore, as is read in the sixth action of the eighth council, in the responses which Metrophanes, bishop of Smyrna, gave to the arguments of Zacharias of Chalcedon concerning the restored Appianary by the Roman Church against the judgment of the African council—namely, that it had not been accepted in Africa—then the judgment of Pope Zosimus in the synod concerning the absolution of Appianary, previously condemned in the African synod, was finally admitted, although he himself had not been admitted to his own church at first because of scandal, but letters of commendation were given to him by the synod, that he might exercise his priesthood in all other churches. |
| 134 | Quae nota propter certa, quae de hac materia superius et inferius continentur. | Which is noteworthy because of the certain matters contained above and below on this subject. |
| 135 | Et pro eodem est epistula Bonifatii papae ad Eulalium, Alexandrinum episcopum, de reconciliatione Afrorum notanda, quia dicit Aurelium Carthaginensem cum collegis suis tempore Bonifatii et Caelestini in superbiam instigante diabolo contra Romanam ecclesiam erectos, sed modo professos omnes libellum synodi tempore Iustiniani celebrati qui incipit: Prima salus, quem supra habes. | And for the same reason, the letter of Pope Boniface to Eulalius, bishop of Alexandria, concerning the reconciliation of the Africans is to be noted, because he says that Aurelius of Carthage, with his colleagues, in the time of Boniface and Celestine, were stirred up against the Roman Church by the instigation of the devil, but now professed all of them the book of the synod held in the time of Justinian, which begins: "First salvation," which you have above. |
| 135 | Et licet illa epistula sit multum notanda, quia pulchre loquitur in principio, quomodo ecclesia ad instar caelestis militiae disparem concordantiam habeat hierarchicam, in qua ad unum primum, scilicet papam Romanum, devenitur, tamen durum videtur illud, quod dicitur in eadem, Valerium cum collegis errasse, quia 216 episcopi, inter quos Augustinus fuit, in unam sententiam concordarunt, quam etiam scripturis firmarunt, ut superius declaratum exstitit. | And although that letter is very noteworthy, because it speaks beautifully at the beginning of how the Church, like a heavenly army, has a diverse hierarchical concord, in which one comes to the first, namely, the Roman pope, yet it seems harsh that it says in the same that Valerius with his colleagues erred, because 216 bishops, among whom Augustine was, agreed on one opinion, which they also confirmed by scripture, as has been declared above. |
| 135 | Et si postea reducti sunt ad recognitionem auctoritate sedis quoad appellationem et cognitionem, non esset propterea dicendum eos prius errasse, &laddnisi hoc intelligeretur sic, quod ipsa Africana ecclesia in hoc erravit, quod Sardicensis concilii statutum non acceptavit, quoniam ut superius quodam loco dictum est, Augustinus non reputavit illud concilium catholicum, sed potius Arianum. | And if they were later reduced to recognition by the authority of the See concerning appeal and judgment, it should not therefore be said that they previously erred, unless this were understood in this way, that the African Church erred in this, that it did not accept the decree of the Sardican council, since, as stated above in a certain place, Augustine did not consider that council Catholic, but rather Arian. |
| 135 | Tamen quia tota ecclesia eius statuta admisit, ut legitur in gestis octavi universalis concilii, tunc et Afri etiam idem facere debebant quoad receptionem statutorum catholicorum non habendo respectum ad statuentes. | However, because the whole Church admitted its decrees, as is read in the acts of the eighth universal council, then the Africans also ought to have done the same with regard to the reception of the Catholic decrees, without regard to the decree-makers. |
| 135 | Fuit autem in Sardicensi concilio in honorem memoriae sancti Petri statutum gravatum ad Romanum episcopum appellare posse proponente et promovente hoc Hosio, Cordubensi episcopo, legato apostolicae sedis in illa synodo, ut hoc habetur 6 q. | It was, however, decreed in the Sardican council, in honor of the memory of Saint Peter, that it was possible to appeal to the Roman bishop, proposed and promoted by Hosius, bishop of Cordova, a legate of the Apostolic See in that synod, as is found in 6 q. |
| 135 | 4 Quod si aliquis, quod est valde notandum. | 4 If anyone, which is very noteworthy. |
| 135 | Quoniam ille textus probat ex dispositione synodica ob honorem memoriae sancti Petri Romanum pontificem praelatum in iudicando particularibus conciliis non nisi per formam ibi traditam, scilicet quod ipse potest sententiam approbare, sed non improbare nisi per novam synodum, ut probat ille textus administrationem papae valde a iure positivo et consensu synodico dependere. | Because that text proves that, by synodical disposition, in honor of the memory of Saint Peter, the Roman pontiff is preferred in judging particular councils, not except by the form there handed down, namely, that he can approve a sentence, but not disapprove it except by a new synod, as that text proves that the administration of the pope depends greatly on positive law and synodical consent. |
| 135 | &radd | &radd |
| 136 | Forte diceres: etiam haec regula de universali concilio universae ecclesiae vera est, quoniam nec illius synodi etiam constitutiones absque apostolicae sedis, immo Romani pontificis auctoritate ratae subsistunt. | Perhaps you would say: this rule is also true of a universal council of the whole Church, since even the constitutions of that synod do not stand firm without the authority of the apostolic see, indeed of the Roman pontiff. |
| 136 | Fateor de constitutionibus fidem tangentibus verum esse quod, sedis apostolicae auctoritas nisi interveniat, ratae non sunt, immo et ipsius pontificis Romani consensus intervenire debet, cum sit princeps in episcopatu fidei; sic et in aliis omnibus constitutionibus, quoniam ipsae robur a concordia synodica recipiunt. | I admit that what is said about constitutions touching on faith is true, that unless the authority of the apostolic see intervenes, they are not valid; indeed, the consent of the Roman pontiff himself must intervene, since he is the prince in the episcopate of faith; so too in all other constitutions, since they receive their strength from synodal concord. |
| 136 | Nam etiam minimus suffraganeus in provinciali aut canonicus in episcopali aut metropolitanus in patriarchali synodo est ideo de sui synodi essentia, quia robur ex omnium concordia dependet, sicut Damasus papa concilium Ariminense ex hoc nullum arguit, quia Vincentius, qui longo tempore fuit episcopus, et alii episcopi consensum non dederunt. | For even the least suffragan in a provincial synod, or a canon in an episcopal synod, or a metropolitan in a patriarchal synod, is therefore of the essence of his synod, because its strength depends on the concord of all, just as Pope Damasus argues that the council of Ariminum was null for this reason, because Vincent, who was bishop for a long time, and other bishops did not give their consent. |
| 136 | Immo credo nullum dubitare, quin actus, qui habet formam essentialem, secundum quam fieri debet, sit invalidus illa non servata. | Indeed, I believe that no one doubts that an act which has an essential form, according to which it ought to be done, is invalid if that form is not observed. |
| 136 | Sic crederem papam ordinatis cardinalibus secundum provinciarum legationem, sicut alibi tetigi, etiam uno solo excluso, in universali statuto universalem Romanam ecclesiam respiciente nihil agere debere. | Thus I would believe that the pope, having ordained cardinals according to the legation of the provinces, as I have touched on elsewhere, should do nothing in a universal statute concerning the universal Roman Church, even with a single one excluded. |
| 136 | Igitur non habet hoc dubium in capite synodi, scilicet metropolita in provinciali et papa in generali vel universali. | Therefore, this doubt does not exist in the head of the synod, namely the metropolitan in a provincial synod and the pope in a general or universal synod. |
| 136 | Unde sicut quocumque, qui alias tenetur synodis interesse, et volenti et potenti spreto iudicium synodi, quia non recto ordine caritatis processit, reprehendi posset, ita fortius in capite. | Hence, just as anyone who is otherwise bound to attend synods, and who disregards the judgment of the synod out of unwillingness or inability, because it did not proceed in the right order of charity, could be reproved, so much more strongly in the case of the head. |
| 137 | Non tamen est hoc verum quod in synodo rite congregata admissis admittendis et rite celebrata auctoritas ita etiam ab ipso capite dependeat, quod nisi in quamcumque diffinitionem consentiat, quod tunc illa diffinitio sit nulla, quia tunc iudicium non esset synodi, sed unius tantum, quod implicat. | However, it is not true that in a synod rightly assembled, with those to be admitted admitted and rightly celebrated, authority also depends so much on the head itself that if it does not consent to any definition, then that definition is null, because then the judgment would not be that of the synod, but of one person only, which is implied. |
| 137 | Et quia quisque ad synodum pergens iudicio maioris partis se submittere tenetur, quia hanc praesupponit quod maior pars regulariter vincit, tunc synodus finaliter ex concordia omnium diffinit, licet varia sint etiam particularium vota, quoniam iuxta maiorem partem concludit. | And because everyone going to a synod is bound to submit to the judgment of the majority, because this presupposes that the majority regularly wins, then the synod finally defines from the concord of all, although the votes of particular individuals may be varied, because it concludes according to the majority. |
| 137 | Nulla tamen conclusio, maxime in materia fidei, esset secura, nisi ad unitatem vota reducerentur, sicut in omnibus conciliis legimus actum. | However, no conclusion, especially in matters of faith, would be secure unless the votes were reduced to unity, as we read was done in all councils. |
| 137 | Et cum isto intellectu satisfieri posset volenti recte auctoritates, quas Romani pontifices in suis epistulis ponunt, intelligere. | And with this understanding, one could satisfy those who wish to understand correctly the authorities which the Roman pontiffs place in their letters. |
| 137 | Dico Romani pontifices, quoniam in conciliis parum de illis omnibus invenire potui, quae praedictis positionibus meis ad plenum non concordarent. | I say Roman pontiffs, because in the councils I could find little that did not fully agree with my aforementioned positions. |
| 138 | Capitulum XVI. | Chapter XVI. |
| 138 | Verum quia multi dubitare videntur, quae personae ad concilium admitti et similiter ad subscriptionem debeant, ideo hoc est considerandum quod, licet Aegyptiaci, qui de Alexandria cum Dioscoro Calcedonam venerunt, cum aliis in Calcedonensi concilio de hoc quaestionem habuissent et saepe clamatum fuisset, ut in gestis eiusdem concilii legitur quod concilium episcoporum esset et alii expelli deberent, non tamen legitur ibi eapropter non-episcopos expulsos. | But because many seem to doubt which persons should be admitted to the council and similarly to the subscription, therefore this is to be considered: although the Egyptians who came from Alexandria with Dioscorus to Chalcedon, with others in the Chalcedonian council, had a question about this, and it had often been cried out, as is read in the acts of the same council, that it was a council of bishops and that others should be expelled, nevertheless it is not read there that non-bishops were expelled on that account. |
| 138 | In quinto concilio universali legitur quod omnes usque ad lectores se subscripserunt, in sexto et octavo presbyteros et monachos, imperatorem et senatum et diaconos se subscripsisse et semper in sessionibus et &laddsubscriptionibus&radd in loco principalis domini recipiebantur, facit c. | In the fifth universal council it is read that all up to the readers subscribed themselves; in the sixth and eighth, that the presbyters and monks, the emperor and senate, and the deacons subscribed themselves, and were always received in the sessions and subscriptions in the principal place of the lord, makes c. |
| 138 | Praecipimus 93 di. | We order 93 di. |

| 138 | Tamen in sexta Constantinopolitana synodo, ubi subscriptiones ponuntur Agathonis papae et sui concilii, non legitur alios quam episcopos aut eos repraesentantes subscripsisse diffinitive. | However, in the sixth Constantinopolitan synod, where the subscriptions of Pope Agatho and his council are placed, it is not read that others than bishops or those representing them subscribed definitively. |
| 138 | Unde diffinitio et statuendi potestas forte semper episcoporum de iure fuit, 12 di. | Hence the power of definition and enactment was perhaps always the right of bishops, 12 di. |
| 138 | Omnia, ubi textus dicit statuta in conciliis episcoporum recipi debere, &laddet&radd licet alii vocati abbates et monachi etiam se subscriberent, non tamen hoc generaliter factum legitur cum verbo diffinitivo, &laddde quo 1 q. | Everything, where the text says that statutes in councils of bishops should be received, adds that although other invited abbots and monks also subscribed themselves, nevertheless this is not read as having been done generally with a definitive word, from which 1 q. |
| 138 | 7 Convenientibus&radd. | 7 To those who meet. |
| 138 | Unde in universali concilio, dum de fide tractatur, mirandum satis, cum laici inveniantur admissi, cur non episcopi admitti ad non tantum consulendum, sed ad simul statuendum et subscribendum, si saltem valentes et intelligentes forent, non deberent. | Hence, in a universal council, when faith is being treated, it is quite remarkable that since laymen are found to have been admitted, why bishops should not be admitted not only to consult, but also to enact and subscribe together, if at least they were able and intelligent, they should not. |
| 138 | In aliis autem, ubi non secundum unanimitatem, sed vocum pluralitatem diffinitio exspectatur, ibi discretio et prudentia et auctoritas merito ponderari debet, ne fatuorum iudicium, quorum infinitus est numerus, numero vota sapientum vincat. | In others, however, where the definition is expected not according to unanimity, but according to the plurality of votes, there discretion and prudence and authority should rightly be weighed, lest the judgment of fools, whose number is infinite, overcome the votes of the wise by number. |
| 139 | Quare nec laicos nec indifferenter clericos puto admitti debere, sed electos et doctos viros ecclesiasticos non puto etiam in iudicio spernendos, cum bonum rei publicae tantum quaeratur, et non obstat, undecumque veniat, dum saltem inveniatur. | Therefore, I do not think that laymen or indiscriminately clerics should be admitted, but I do not think that chosen and learned ecclesiastical men should be despised even in judgment, since only the good of the commonwealth is sought, and it does not matter whence it comes, as long as it is found. |
| 139 | Laici vero, qui in universali concilio, ubi de fide quaestio diffiniri debet, admissi leguntur, ut infra habetur in 17 canone octavi universalis concilii et 96 di. | Laymen, however, who are read as having been admitted to a universal council where a question of faith is to be defined, as is found below in canon 17 of the eighth universal council and 96 di. |
| 139 | Ubi nam, etiam aliis gestis in concilio se subscribunt, sed ut testes. | Where, indeed, they also subscribe themselves in the acts of the council, but as witnesses. |
| 139 | Unde legitur in gestis octavi concilii actione quarta: «Senatores magnificentissimi et gloriosissimi principes per Bahanem patricium et praepositum dixerunt ad concilium: Imperatores nostri sancti miserunt servos suos, qui senatus vocantur, qui voluntate dei honoratus est secundum omnia, ut simus districti eorum quae geruntur auditores. | Hence it is read in the acts of the eighth council, action four: "The most magnificent and glorious senators and princes through Bahan the patrician and praepositus said to the council: Our holy emperors have sent their servants, who are called senators, who have been honored by the will of God in all things, so that we may be diligent listeners of what is being done. |
| 139 | Si vultis ergo a nobis, sicut se habet ordo synodicus, in fine sanctae universalis huius synodi exigere proprias subscriptiones, per me, indignum servum sanctorum imperatorum nostrorum, cuncti fratres mei et compatricii dicunt sanctissimo domino nostro patriarchae et sanctissimis vicariis senioris Romae et orientalium sedium: Nisi audiverimus et ab ipso Photio stante in conspectu nostro et episcopis eius, ut in conspectu nostro obserantur ora ipsorum ex canonicis et synodicis praeceptionibus, non scribet manus nostra unam litteram in synodo ista. | If you therefore wish to require from us, as the synodal order has it, at the end of this holy universal synod, our own subscriptions, through me, unworthy servant of our holy emperors, all my brothers and compatriots say to our most holy lord patriarch and the most holy vicars of the senior see of Rome and the eastern sees: Unless we have heard and from Photius himself standing in our presence and his bishops, so that their mouths may be observed in our presence from canonical and synodal precepts, our hand will not write one letter in this synod. |
| 139 | Audiant iudicata per Nicolaum papam in synodo Romana, et si nihil contradixerint, sanabitur mundus ex condescensione ipsorum. | Let them hear the judgments given by Pope Nicholas in the Roman synod, and if they contradict nothing, the world will be healed by their condescension. |
| 139 | Si hoc autem factum non fuerit, scimus, quia nostri non egetis ad subscribendum in fine a vobis gestorum. | If, however, this has not been done, we know that you do not need us to subscribe at the end of your acts. |
| 139 | » Ecce, quod laici se ut testes subscribere habentes in concilio id, quod iustitiae ratio postulat, ut recte se subscribant, exigere possunt a concilio. | " Behold, laymen having subscribed themselves as witnesses in the council can demand from the council what the reason of justice requires, that they may rightly subscribe themselves. |
| 139 | Et haec sufficiant pro ista materia. | And these things suffice for this matter. |
| 140 | Capitulum XVII. | Chapter 17. |
| 140 | Per ea quae superius habentur, satis ad quaestionem quae difficilis reputatur, an scilicet universale concilium sit supra papam, faciliter potest responsio dari. | Through the things that are held above, a response can easily be given to the question that is considered difficult, namely whether the universal council is above the pope. |
| 140 | Nam universale sive generale concilium patriarchale subiectum semper legitur Romano pontifici, &laddsuo modo sicut ex superioribus et subsequentibus patet et&radd sicut in sexto capitulo Nicaeni concilii de Alexandrino et aliis sedibus diffinitio habet, 65 di. | For the universal or general patriarchal council is always read as subject to the Roman pontiff, and in the same way as is clear from the preceding and following, as it is defined in the sixth chapter of the Nicaean council regarding Alexander and other seats, 65 days. |
| 140 | Mos, et post hoc omnia concilia idem dicunt. | Custom, and after this all councils say the same. |
| 140 | Unde de hoc universali concilio credo verum esse quod, nisi in fide Romanus pontifex erraverit, quod tunc iudicari per concilium non possit. | Hence, I believe it to be true that, unless the Roman pontiff has erred in faith, it cannot be judged by the council. |
| 140 | Quamdiu enim fidelis est, caput remanet. | For as long as he is faithful, the head remains. |
| 140 | Quare ab inferiori potestate iudicari non potest, quoniam omnium illorum habet potestatem iuxta diffinitionem sexti capituli Nicaeni concilii, et cum hoc remanet totius alterius partis ecclesiae aliorum patriarcharum caput in unitate ecclesiae catholicae quae per fidem est. | Therefore, it cannot be judged by a lower authority, because it has power over all of them according to the definition of the sixth chapter of the Nicaean council, and as long as it remains, the head of the other part of the church of the other patriarchs remains in the unity of the Catholic Church which is by faith. |
| 140 | Unde recte, sicut metropolitanus, nisi in fide erret, per suam synodum iudicari non potest iuxta diffinitionem 10 canonis octavi universalis concilii, et notatur De praebendis Grave et 11 q. | Hence, it is rightly judged, just as a metropolitan, unless in faith it erred, cannot be judged by its own synod according to the definition of the eighth canon of the universal council, and it is noted in the Book of Prebends Grave and 11 q. |
| 140 | 1 Si clericus, ubi Archidiaconus metropolitanum, quia caput concilii provincialis, per ipsum concilium puniri non posse notat. | 1 If a cleric, where the archdeacon is metropolitan, because the head of the provincial council cannot be punished by the same council, it is noted. |
| 140 | Unde Anacletus papa in epistula ad omnes episcopos quae incipit: Benedictus Deus: «Doctor vel pastor ecclesiae, si a fide exorbitaverit, erit a fidelibus corrigendus, sed pro reprobis moribus magis est tolerandus quam distringendus. | Hence, Pope Anacletus in the letter to all bishops which begins: "Blessed God: 'The doctor or pastor of the church, if he has strayed from faith, will be corrected by the faithful, but he is to be tolerated rather than distrained for wicked morals.' |
| 140 | » Et intelligit per fideles subditos, ut patet ex textu immediate sequenti, et ratio est manifesta, quare de illis intelligi debeat, quia pastor ecclesiae ab ecclesia, quae grex ovium est, non potest corrigi, sed si infidelis fuerit, pastor non est, et tunc corrigendus est per anathema et subtractionem oboedientiae. | "And he understands by faithful subjects, as is clear from the immediately following text, and the reason is manifest, why it should be understood of them, because the pastor of the church cannot be corrected by the church, which is the flock of sheep, but if he is unfaithful, he is not a pastor, and then he is to be corrected by anathema and subtraction of obedience. |
| 141 | Et non habet dubium in haeresi dampnata, quia in sententiam incidit semel dampnatae pravitatis, ut de Acatio Gelasius papa ad Anastasium imperatorem scribit et ad universos episcopos per Dardaniam. | And there is no doubt in the case of heresy condemned, because he has fallen into the sentence of condemned wickedness, as Pope Gelasius writes to Emperor Anastasius and to all bishops through Dardania. |
| 141 | Dicit enim: «Pro constitutionis antiquae observatione cunctos semel dampnatae pravitatis participes universalis ecclesia duxit esse refutandos, sicut Nicaena synodus Arium dampnans omnes Arianos includit. | For he says: 'In accordance with the observation of the ancient constitution, the universal church has led all those who have once fallen into condemned wickedness to be refuted, just as the Nicaean synod, condemning Arius, includes all Arians. |
| 141 | » Si vero non esset dampnata haeresis, tunc, quousque constet per sententiam haereticum eum esse, ab eo recedendum non est iuxta dictum 10 canonem. | "If, however, the heresy were not condemned, then, until it is established by the sentence of the heretic that he is so, one should not depart from him according to the tenth canon. |
| 141 | Potest tamen propter errorem in fide et secrete corrigi per subditos pastor et superiori denuntiari. | However, he can be corrected secretly by his subjects and his superior informed, because of error in faith. |
| 141 | Unde Fabianus papa in epistula ad orientales quae incipit: Exigit dilectio, dicit: «Si enim deviaverit a fide episcopus, erit corrigendus primo secrete a subditis. | Hence, Pope Fabian in the letter to the Orientals which begins: 'Love demands, says: 'If a bishop has strayed from faith, he will be corrected first secretly by his subjects. |
| 141 | Quod si incorrigibilis, quod absit, apparuerit, tunc erit accusandus apud primates suos aut ad sedem apostolicam. | But if he appears to be incorrigible, which God forbid, then he will be accused before his own primates or to the apostolic see. |
| 141 | Pro aliis vero actibus suis magis est tolerandus a subditis suis quam accusandus. | For other actions of his are to be tolerated by his subjects rather than accused. |

| 141 | Si vero haereticus foret, tunc, quia anathema est in haeresi eo ipso, non ex iure positivo, quoniam haereticus ob errorem in intellectu et pertinaciam in voluntate a toto corpore ecclesiae se separavit, ut dicit sanctus Cyprianus et habetur 1 q. | If he were a heretic, then, because anathema is in heresy by itself, not by positive law, since the heretic has separated himself from the whole body of the church by error in intellect and stubbornness in will, as Saint Cyprian says and is held in 1 q. |

| 142 | Eo modo legimus laicos in concilio anathema dixisse dampnatis publicis haereticis et singulares homines etiam extra concilium Romanis pontificibus haereticis anathema dixisse. | In this way, we read that laypeople have said anathema to public heretics condemned and individual men have also said anathema to heretics of the Roman pontiffs outside the council. |
| 142 | Sic superiores et maiores in administratione, dum haeretici fiunt, per inferiores dicuntur deponi, quando illi propter anathema, quod incidit ob haeresim, ab eodem separantur. | In the same way, superiors and elders are said to be deposed by inferiors when they become heretics, when they are separated from the same by anathema, which occurs because of heresy. |
| 143 | Unde cum per subtractionem oboedientiae cesset superioris administratio, et quia superioritas illa, ut in archiepiscopo, primate et papa, in administratione consistit, cessante administratione recte depositi censentur, sicut in c. | Hence, when the administration of the superior ceases by subtraction of obedience, and because the superiority of the archbishop, primate, and pope consists in administration, the deposed are rightly considered to have ceased, as in c. |

| 144 | Et hoc non videtur habere dubium in canonibus universalium conciliorum catholicae ecclesiae latae sententiae, quoniam ad illos omnes catholici obligantur, ut infra ponetur latius; in authenticis statutis comminatorialibus illorum conciliorum ac aliis omnibus quorumcumque conciliorum statutis, nisi per submissionem se papa ad eorum observantiam obligasset, clarum est hoc locum in papa non habere. | And this does not seem to have doubt in the canons of the universal councils of the Catholic Church, because all Catholics are bound to them, as will be put more broadly below; in the authentic statutes of the comminatory councils and all other statutes of the councils, unless the pope has submitted himself to their observance, it is clear that this place does not have in the pope. |
| 144 | Et suo modo reddendo singula singulis in aliis patriarchis et archiepiscopis dicendum, scilicet quod corrigi possunt secundum statuta latae sententiae maioris auctoritatis, in suo etiam concilio per viam declarationis de incidisse, ad instar sicut in papa dictum, alias non nisi exhortatorie. | And in the same way, rendering each to each in other patriarchs and archbishops, it should be said, namely that they can be corrected according to the statutes of the greater authority laid down, in their own council by the way of declaration of having fallen, just as in the pope, otherwise not unless exhortatory. |
| 145 | Sed an universale concilium proprie captum, scilicet quod universam catholicam ecclesiam repraesentat, sit supra patriarchas et Romanum pontificem, credo dubium esse non debere. | But whether the universal council, properly taken, namely which represents the whole Catholic Church, is above the patriarchs and the Roman pontiff, I believe there should be no doubt. |

| 146 | Sed hoc nobis sufficiat, quod, licet Romanus pontifex ut successor Petri a Christo magna habeat privilegia et altam potestatem ex sede et cathedra, quae privilegia cum sede et stabilia sunt, tamen primitivitas illa, qua Romanus pontifex primas est omnium ecclesiarum, partim etiam ab hominibus et canonibus est iuxta superius dicta – dicit enim Anacletus papa, quod, dum Petrus princeps apostolorum constitueretur a Christo, apostolorum consensu factum, 22 di. | But let this suffice for us, that although the Roman Pontiff, as the successor of Peter, has great privileges and high power from the See and Chair, which privileges are stable with the See, nevertheless that primitiveness by which the Roman Pontiff is the first among all churches is partly also from men and canons, according to what has been said above – for Pope Anacletus says that, while Peter was constituted prince of the apostles by Christ, it was done with the consent of the apostles, 22 di. |

| 146 | Non est enim dubium Antiochenum patriarcham sedere ex successione in sede Petri et tamen primatem ex hoc tantum non esse, quoniam Antiochena cessit Romanae. | For there is no doubt that the Antiochene patriarch sits in the See of Peter by succession, and yet is not a primate from this alone, because the Antiochene yielded to the Roman. |
| 146 | Unde Marcellus papa Antiochenis in epistula quae incipit: Sollicitudinem omnium, dicit: «Si enim vestra Antiochena, quae olim prima erat, Romanae cessit, nulla est quae eius non sit subiecta ditioni, ad quam omnes quasi ad caput episcopi qui voluerint fugere eamque appellare poterunt. | Whence Pope Marcellus says to the Antiochenes in the letter which begins: *Sollicitudinem omnium*: “For if your Antiochene church, which was once first, yielded to the Roman, there is none which is not subject to its dominion, to which all bishops who wish may flee and appeal as to a head.” |
| 146 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 146 | Unde in synodica Leonis Noni ad Petrum, Antiochenum patriarcham, sic scribitur: «Ab apostolica tua sede nostram apostolicam consulendo perpendimus tuam prudentiam nolle deviare a dominico et omnium sanctorum patrum concordi decreto, quo inviolabiliter cunctis in toto orbe terrarum ecclesiis sancta Romana ecclesia et apostolica sedes caput praeponitur, ad quam maiores et difficiliores causae omnium ecclesiarum diffiniendae referantur. | Whence in the synodal letter of Leo IX to Peter, Patriarch of Antioch, it is written thus: “By consulting our apostolic see from your apostolic see, we perceive your prudence does not wish to deviate from the concordant decree of the Lord and all the holy fathers, by which the holy Roman Church and the apostolic see are inviolably placed as the head over all churches throughout the whole world, to which the greater and more difficult causes of all churches are to be referred for determination.” |
| 146 | Sic omnia veneranda concilia, sic leges humanae promulgant, sic ipse sanctus sanctorum, rex regum, dominus dominantium confirmat, quatenus ibi principalis dignitatis et totius ecclesiasticae disciplinae venerabilis apex praefulgeat et praecellat, ubi ipse vertex et cardo apostolorum Petrus carnis suae beatam resurrectionem in novissimo die exspectat. | Thus all venerable councils enact, thus human laws are promulgated, thus the Holy One of Holies, King of kings, Lord of lords, confirms, so that there the venerable apex of principal dignity and of all ecclesiastical discipline may brightly shine forth and excel, where Peter, the vertex and hinge of the apostles, awaits the blessed resurrection of his flesh on the last day. |
| 146 | Nimirum solus est ille, pro quo, ne deficeret eius fides, dominus et salvator asseruit se rogasse dicens: Simon, Simon, ecce satanas expetiit, vos ut cribraret sicut triticum. | Indeed, he alone is that one, for whom, lest his faith should fail, the Lord and Savior asserted that he had prayed, saying: Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to sift you as wheat. |
| 146 | Ego autem rogavi pro te, ut non deficiat fides tua, et tu aliquando conversus confirma fratres tuos. | But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail, and you, when you have turned again, strengthen your brothers. |
| 146 | Quae venerabilis et efficax oratio obtinuit, quod hactenus fides Petri non defecit nec defectura creditur in throno illius in saeculum saeculi, sed confirmabit corda fratrum variis concutienda fidei periclitationibus, sicut usque nunc confirmare non cessavit. | Which venerable and efficacious prayer obtained that hitherto the faith of Peter has not failed, nor is it believed that it will fail in his throne for ever and ever, but it will strengthen the hearts of the brothers, shaken by various perils to faith, just as it has not ceased to strengthen until now. |
| 146 | » Haec ille. | This he says. |
| 147 | Unde non puto universale concilium illa privilegia primitivitatis a Romana sede iuxta aliorum conciliorum diffinitionem tollere umquam velle, quoniam dicit idem <Leo> contra praesumptiones Michaelis Constantinopolitani c. | Whence I do not think that a universal council would ever wish to remove those privileges of primitiveness from the Roman See according to the definition of other councils, because the same Leo says against the presumptions of Michael of Constantinople c. |
| 147 | 36: «Quisquis Romanae ecclesiae auctoritatem vel privilegia evacuare seu minuere nititur, non hic unius ecclesiae, sed totius Christianitatis subversionem et interitum machinatur. | 36: “Whoever strives to evacuate or diminish the authority or privileges of the Roman Church, plots not the subversion and destruction of one church here, but of all Christendom.” |

| 148 | Sed quia sedentes in ipsa sede ab hominibus assumuntur deviabiles et peccabiles, nunc maxime mundo ad finem tendente et malitia excrescente sua potestate ad aedificationem data ad destructionem abutuntur, quis dubitare potest sanae mentis absque verae potestatis et privilegii sedis diminutione universale concilium tam in abusum quam abutentem potestatem habere pro sui ipsius conservatione et totius ecclesiae salutari ordinato regimine? | But because those sitting in that see are assumed from men, fallible and sinful, now especially with the world tending to its end and malice increasing, they abuse their power given for edification to destruction, who can doubt with a sound mind, without diminution of the true power and privilege of the see, that a universal council may have power, for its own preservation and the salutary ordered government of the whole Church, over both the abuse and the abuser of power? |
| 148 | Tamen dicere quod universale concilium etiam super primatia ecclesiae Romanae cognoscere et diffinire non possit, credo male dictum esse, quoniam expresse Calcedonense concilium se de hoc intromisisse et iudicasse in gestis legitur. | Nevertheless, to say that a universal council cannot also know and define concerning the primacy of the Roman Church, I believe to be wrongly said, because the Council of Chalcedon is expressly read in its acts to have interfered with and judged this matter. |
| 148 | Quare universaliter dici potest universale concilium repraesentativum catholicae ecclesiae habere potestatem immediate a Christo et esse omni respectu tam supra papam quam sedem apostolicam. | Wherefore it can be universally said that a universal council, representative of the Catholic Church, has power immediately from Christ and is in every respect above both the pope and the apostolic see. |
| 149 | Et hanc sententiam probant plura gesta et canones et rationes. | And this opinion is proved by many acts and canons and reasons. |
| 149 | Nam disceptatio, quae in Calcedonensi concilio facta fuit super primatia, probat hoc; similiter et diffinitio Nicaeni concilii in eodem concilio Calcedonensi pro parte Romanae sedis producta, ac etiam quod in plenariis conciliis gesta et iudicata per Romanum pontificem etiam synodice inveniuntur repetita et examinata, ut in Calcedonensi concilio iudicium Leonis contra Dioscorum, et in sexta synodo iudicium synodicum Martini papae contra Pyrrhum et Sergium et in octava synodo universali iudicium Nicolai et Adriani Romanorum pontificum contra Photium cum similibus multis. | For the disputation which was made in the Council of Chalcedon concerning the primacy proves this; similarly the definition of the Nicene Council produced in the same Chalcedonian Council on behalf of the Roman See, and also that in plenary councils the acts and judgments are found repeated and examined synodically by the Roman Pontiff, as in the Council of Chalcedon the judgment of Leo against Dioscorus, and in the Sixth Synod the synodal judgment of Pope Martin against Pyrrhus and Sergius, and in the Eighth Universal Synod the judgment of Popes Nicholas and Adrian against Photius, with many similar examples. |
| 149 | Unde Augustinus in epistula ad Glorium et Elusium quae incipit: Dixit quidem apostolus, postquam tractavit de sententia 70 episcoporum contra Caecilianum, et quomodo illa per Melchiadem papam et certos alios episcopos per Constantinum imperatorem eidem adiunctos retractata fuit, dicit quod opponentes se contra sententiam Melchiadis papae et sociorum dixerunt quasi malos se esse iudices perpessos. | Whence Augustine, in the letter to Glorius and Elusius which begins: *Dixit quidem apostolus*, after treating of the sentence of 70 bishops against Caecilian, and how it was retracted through Pope Melchiades and certain other bishops joined to him by the Emperor Constantine, says that those opposing said against the sentence of Pope Melchiades and his associates as if they had suffered evil judges. |
| 149 | Quae vox est omnium malorum litigatorum, cum fuerint etiam manifestissima veritate superati, quasi non eis adhuc iustissime dici possit: «Ecce, putemus illos episcopos qui Romae iudicaverunt non bonos iudices fuisse; restabat adhuc plenarium universae ecclesiae concilium, ubi etiam cum ipsis iudicibus causa posset agitari, ut, si male iudicasse convicti essent, eorum sententiae solverentur. | Which is the voice of all evil litigants, when they have been overcome even by the most manifest truth, as if it could not yet be justly said to them: “Behold, let us suppose that those bishops who judged at Rome were not good judges; a plenary council of the whole Church still remained, where the case could also be pleaded with those same judges, so that, if they were convicted of having judged badly, their sentences might be dissolved.” |
| 149 | Quod utrum fecerint, probent. | Whether they did this, let them prove. |
| 149 | Nos enim non esse factum facile probamus ex eo, quod totus orbis communicat ei, aut si factum est, etiam ibi sunt victi. | For we easily prove that it was not done from the fact that the whole world communicates with him, or if it was done, they were also defeated there. |

| 150 | Nec habet hoc dubium, cum Christus dicat Petro: «Si ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi sicut ethnicus et publicanus. | Nor is there any doubt about this, since Christ says to Peter: “If he will not hear the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a publican.” |
| 150 | » Unde manifestum est quod non oboediens ecclesiae aut concilio eius eam repraesentanti debet esse Petro et eius successoribus sicut ethnicus et publicanus. | Whence it is manifest that one disobedient to the Church or its council representing it ought to be to Peter and his successors as a Gentile and a publican. |
| 150 | Et hoc probari potest auctoritate sancti Gregorii papae in epistula 214 in Registro, ubi, postquam reprehendit Ioannem, patriarcham Constantinopolitanum, de eo, quod se universalem patriarcham scripsit, in fine: «Et nos quidem, in quibus per ausum temerarium culpa committitur, servamus, quod praecipit veritas dicens: Si peccaverit in te frater tuus etc. | And this can be proved by the authority of Pope St. Gregory in letter 214 in the Register, where, after he has reproved John, Patriarch of Constantinople, for having written himself universal patriarch, at the end: “And we indeed, in whom fault is committed through rash presumption, observe what truth commands, saying: If your brother sins against you etc. |
| 150 | Ego itaque per responsales meos semel et bis verbis humilibus hoc, qui in tota ecclesia peccator, corripere studui, per me scribo. | Therefore, through my respondents once and twice with humble words I have striven to correct this man, who is a sinner in the whole Church, I write through me. |
| 150 | Quidquid humiliter facere debui, non omisi, sed in ea correptione despicior. | Whatever I ought to do humbly, I have not omitted, but in that correction I am despised. |
| 150 | Restat ut ecclesiam debeam adire. | It remains that I ought to approach the Church. |
| 150 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 150 | Ecce Gregorium papam fateri, quomodo correctio fraterna eo modo ad eum spectat, quo Christus mandat, scilicet ut ultimo ecclesia adeatur tamquam supremum iudicium. | Behold Pope Gregory confesses how fraternal correction pertains to him in the way that Christ commands, namely that finally the Church should be approached as the supreme judgment. |
| 151 | Similiter et plures aliae dispositivae ordinationes de Romanorum sede, quae in diversis conciliis universalibus factae sunt, et manifestum est illas dispositiones a maiori auctoritate robur cepisse, quare maior universalis concilii auctoritas. | Similarly, many other dispositive ordinances from the See of the Romans, which were made in various universal councils, and it is evident that those dispositions received strength from a greater authority, hence the greater authority of the universal council. |
| 151 | Deinde canon octavi concilii de potestate patriarcharum, qui etiam de patriarcha Romano loquitur, et similiter canon 10 eiusdem concilii qui incipit: Divina, hoc probat. | Then, the canon of the eighth council concerning the power of the patriarchs, which also speaks of the Roman patriarch, and similarly the tenth canon of the same council, which begins: "Divina," this proves. |
| 151 | Nam dicit: «Iuste ac congruenter haec sancta et universalis synodus diffinit et statuit quod nullus laicorum aut monachorum aut aliquis de catalogo clericorum ante diligentem examinationem et synodicam sententiam a communione se separet proprii patriarchae, licet criminalem quamlibet eius causam se nosse praetendat. | For it says: "Justly and fittingly, this holy and universal synod defines and decrees that no layman, monk, or anyone from the catalog of clerics should separate himself from the communion of his own patriarch before a diligent examination and synodical sentence, even if he pretends to know any criminal cause of his." |
| 151 | » Non dicit de haeresi, quia, licet recedendum non sit, ut dicit textus iste et 2 q. | It does not speak of heresy, because, although it is not to be departed from, as this text says and in 2 q. |
| 151 | 7 Sacerdotes et 8 q. | 7 "Priests" and 8 q. |
| 151 | 4 Nonne, tamen hoc verum nisi in haeresi, quia etiam si toleretur, attento quod in dampnatam haeresim incidit, tunc excommunicatus est, 24 q. | 4 "Is it not," yet this is true except in heresy, because even if it is tolerated, considering that he has fallen into condemned heresy, then he is excommunicated, 24 q. |
| 151 | 1 c. | 1 c. |
| 151 | 1; et glossa allegat concordantias in &laddpraefato&radd c. | 1; and the gloss cites concordances in the aforementioned c. |
| 151 | Sacerdotes et in c. | "Priests" and in c. |
| 151 | Anastasius 19 di. | "Anastasius" 19 di. |
| 151 | Quare ab eo semper recedendum, ut ibidem in glossa et Adrianus papa in synodo in tertia allocutione; et habetur septima actione octavi concilii. | Therefore, one must always depart from him, as in the gloss there and Pope Adrian in the synod in the third allocution; and it is found in the seventh session of the eighth council. |
| 151 | Et quia textus iste in aliis criminibus intelligitur, ergo papa per synodum in criminibus etiam aliis quam haeresi iudicari potest. | And because this text is understood in other crimes, therefore the pope can be judged by the synod even in crimes other than heresy. |
| 152 | Hoc etiam probari potest per dictum sancti Petri ad Clementem, ut habetur in epistula ipsius Clementis ad Iacobum, ubi dicit Petrum sibi dixisse, dum eum successorem constitueret: «Neque enim iudicem aut cognitorem saecularium te constitui voluit hodie Christus, ne provocatus praesentium hominum curis non possis verbo dei vacare. | This can also be proven by the saying of Saint Peter to Clement, as found in the letter of Clement himself to James, where he says that Peter told him, while appointing him as his successor: "For Christ did not wish to appoint you today as a judge or arbiter of secular matters, lest, provoked by the cares of present men, you might not be able to devote yourself to the word of God. |
| 152 | Si enim mundialium curis fueris occupatus, te ipsum decipies et eos qui te audiunt. | For if you are occupied with worldly cares, you will deceive yourself and those who hear you. |
| 152 | Non enim poteris quae ad salutem pertinent plenius singulis quibusque distinguere, et ex eo fit, ut et tu tamquam qui non docueris quae ad salutem hominum pertinent, deponaris, et discipuli per ignorantiam pereant. | For you will not be able to fully distinguish what pertains to salvation for each individual, and from this it happens that you, as one who has not taught what pertains to the salvation of men, are deposed, and the disciples perish through ignorance. |
| 152 | » Haec ibi. | " These things are there. |
| 152 | Non volo tamen astruere Clementem in veritate ad Iacobum ita scripsisse, quia satis veridice habetur illum Iacobum ante Petrum octo annis martyrio decessisse, ut infra in tertia parte dicetur. | However, I do not wish to assert that Clement truly wrote thus to James, because it is sufficiently verified that James died in martyrdom eight years before Peter, as will be said below in the third part. |
| 152 | Sed quia ecclesia non spernit hanc epistulam, quod sufficit, tunc manifestum est etiam papam ex negligentia deponi posse, quia dicit: «Deponaris etc. | But because the Church does not reject this letter, which suffices, then it is evident that even the pope can be deposed for negligence, because it says: "You are deposed etc." |
| 152 | » Quare habetur propositum. | Therefore, the proposition is established. |
| 153 | Ecce ergo quod canon in sententia synodica omnes patriarchas aequiparat, et per gesta concilii illius satis aperte constat semper papam patriarcham Romanum nuncupari. | Behold, therefore, that the canon in the synodical sentence equates all patriarchs, and through the acts of that council it is sufficiently clear that the pope is always called the Roman patriarch. |
| 153 | Et si non est dubium quamlibet criminalem causam alterius cuiuscumque patriarchae per synodum diffiniri posse, sic et Romani patriarchae. | And if there is no doubt that any criminal cause of any other patriarch can be defined by the synod, so also that of the Roman patriarch. |
| 153 | Et quod patriarchae aequiparentur in depositionibus, facit 22 di. | And that the patriarchs are equated in depositions, 22 di. |
| 153 | Diffinimus. | "We define." |
| 153 | Probat etiam idem textus octavi concilii 10 canonis ad depositionem metropolitanorum vel eorum correctionem omnes vicarios aequaliter se habere. | The same text of the eighth council, the tenth canon, also proves that all vicars are equally subject to the deposition or correction of metropolitans. |
| 153 | Unde gesta concilii Calcedonensis in ultima actione et aliis locis ac alia gesta conciliorum probant etiam alios patriarchas quam papam Romanum cum eorum concilio episcopos vel archiepiscopos deposuisse. | Hence, the acts of the Council of Chalcedon in the last session and in other places, as well as the acts of other councils, prove that other patriarchs besides the Roman pope, with their council, have deposed bishops or archbishops. |
| 153 | Oportet igitur illa iura, quae loquuntur solum deponere posse episcopum, intelligi: in suo scilicet patriarchatu. | Therefore, those laws which speak only of deposing a bishop must be understood: namely, in his own patriarchate. |
| 153 | Et videntur allegata gesta Calcedonensis concilii de depositione Anastasii probare patriarcham non cum consilio, sed consensu sui concilii depositiones facere debere. | And the cited acts of the Council of Chalcedon concerning the deposition of Anastasius seem to prove that the patriarch should make depositions not with the counsel, but with the consent of his council. |
| 153 | Dicunt enim episcopi Antiocheni concilii: «Nos deposuimus Athanasium a clero ecclesiae suae accusatum, quia ter vocatus non venit. | For the bishops of the Antiochene council say: "We deposed Athanasius, accused by the clergy of his church, because he did not come when called three times." |
| 153 | » Unde id quod dicit Archidiaconus 22 di. | Hence, what the Archdeacon says in 22 di. |
| 153 | Qua traditione papam sine concilio quem deponere posse, oportet hoc intelligere secundum ea, quae inferius quodam loco habentur: hoc verum sine concilio universalis ecclesiae vel etiam sine patriarchali, ubi privandus seu deponendus incidit in poenam latae sententiae. | That tradition which says the pope can depose without a council must be understood according to what is found below in a certain place: this is true without the council of the universal Church or even without the patriarchal council, where the one to be deprived or deposed falls into the penalty of latae sententiae. |
| 154 | Sed ut hoc, scilicet papam universali concilio totius ecclesiae subesse, clariori diffinitione idem concilium octavum universale explicaret in canone 21 qui incipit: Dominicum sermonem § Porro, cuius pars habetur 22 di. | But that this, namely, that the pope is subject to the universal council of the whole Church, the same eighth universal council explained more clearly in the 21st canon, which begins: "The Lord's sermon § Moreover," a part of which is found in 22 di. |
| 154 | Diffinimus, dicit quod universalis synodus cum convenienti reverentia quamlibet quaestionem de Romanorum sede exortam audire tenetur et in ea proficere aut profectum facere, non tamen audacter sententiam in Romanum pontificem dicere. | "We define," it says that the universal synod is bound to hear with due reverence any question arising from the See of the Romans and to make progress or effect progress in it, but not to pronounce a sentence boldly against the Roman pontiff. |
| 154 | Ecce quod, licet omnem quaestionem de sede apostolica exortam diffinire habeat universale concilium, hoc tamen ob primatiam et reverentiam capitis cum convenienti reverentia et non audacter sententiam dicendo facere debet. | Behold, although the universal council has the power to define every question arising from the apostolic see, yet it must do so with due reverence and not by pronouncing a sentence boldly, out of respect for the primacy and reverence of the head. |
| 155 | Quare manifestum est ex hiis universale concilium simpliciter supra papam esse. | Therefore, it is evident from these that the universal council is simply above the pope. |
| 155 | Nec amplius de hoc opus est exempla producere, cum habeamus varia decreta sacri Basiliensis concilii et etiam Constantiensis, quomodo papa subest &laddconcilio&radd. | Nor is there any need to produce further examples, since we have various decrees of the sacred Council of Basel and also of Constance, how the pope is subject to the council. |
| 155 | Et licet Constantiense tantum in tribus casibus loquatur, clarum est, quod omnes canones &laddfacti aut&radd amplius factibiles ad &laddipsos&radd reducuntur. | And although the Council of Constance speaks only in three cases, it is clear that all canons made or to be made are reducible to them. |
| 155 | Nonne in quinta sessione huius Basiliensis concilii fuit diffinitum nullum per se vel procuratorem incorporatum extra locum concilii etiam auctoritate apostolica trahi posse? | Was it not defined in the fifth session of this Council of Basel that no one could be dragged by himself or by a procurator incorporated outside the place of the council, even by apostolic authority? |
| 155 | Quare hoc, &laddnisi&radd quia hoc cedere posset in praeiudicium concilii? | Why this, unless because this could lead to the prejudice of the council? |
| 155 | Si ergo auctoritas Romani pontificis in particulares personas, quando hoc praesumitur vergi posse in praeiudicium concilii, non potest, quis dubitat totum concilium supra papam esse? | If, therefore, the authority of the Roman pontiff over particular persons, when it is presumed to be able to tend to the prejudice of the council, cannot, who doubts that the whole council is above the pope? |
| 155 | Talia plura decreta sunt huius concilii, quae hoc probant, scilicet citationis et monitionis papae et huiusmodi. | Many such decrees of this council prove this, namely, concerning the citation and admonition of the pope and the like. |
| 156 | Capitulum XVIII. | Chapter XVIII. |
| 156 | Verum, ut profundius videamus huius veritatem, revocemus ad mentem superius de repraesentatione praesidentium dicta et dicamus, quia potestas ligandi et solvendi et infallibilitas et indeviabilitas propter Christi assistentiam usque in consummationem saeculi est in ipsa catholica vera ecclesia. | But, to see the truth of this more deeply, let us recall to mind what was said above concerning the representation of the presiding officers and say that the power of binding and loosing and infallibility and indefectibility, because of Christ's assistance until the consummation of the age, is in the true Catholic Church itself. |
| 156 | Cum autem Romanus pontifex sit membrum illius ecclesiae, quae corpus Christi mysticum est, et infallibilitas non cuilibet membro, sed toti ecclesiae promissa est, tunc, non dubium, potestas indeviabilis ligandi et solvendi totius ecclesiae est supra potestatem Romani pontificis, quamquam ab eodem principio ligandi et solvendi potestas tam ecclesiae quam papae fluat. | Since, however, the Roman pontiff is a member of that Church, which is the mystical body of Christ, and infallibility is promised not to any member, but to the whole Church, then, without doubt, the indefectible power of binding and loosing of the whole Church is above the power of the Roman pontiff, although the power of binding and loosing flows from the same principle for both the Church and the pope. |
| 156 | Et non dico hoc verum tantum de ipsa tota catholica ecclesia, sed etiam de ipsa ecclesia sacerdotali, quae est ut anima una totius ecclesiae, hoc est verum ex Christi promissione et legatione, quia sacerdotium a spiritu sancto positum est ad regendum Christi ecclesiam, ut dicit Petrus apostolus: «Pascite in vobis etc. | And I do not say this is true only of the whole Catholic Church, but also of the priestly Church itself, which is as one soul of the whole Church, this is true from the promise and mission of Christ, because the priesthood was established by the Holy Spirit to govern the Church of Christ, as the Apostle Peter says: "Feed among you etc." |
| 156 | » Quare ipsum sacerdotium actu vel virtualiter congregatum utitur supra tota ecclesia et omnibus membris eius, de quorum numero papa est, sua legatione, quam a Christo habet, totam ecclesiam pascendi. | Therefore, the priesthood itself, whether actually or virtually gathered, uses its mission, which it has from Christ, to feed the whole Church and all its members, of whom the pope is one. |
| 156 | Verum quia universale concilium est congregatio sive ecclesia de membris universae catholicae ecclesiae congregata et repraesentat ex hoc universam ecclesiam, tunc considerandum est, quod Romanus pontifex in eo, quod summus pontifex, etiam habet figuratam et repraesentativam personam unius universae ecclesiae. | But because the universal council is the gathering or Church of members of the universal Catholic Church gathered together and represents the universal Church, then it must be considered that the Roman pontiff, as the supreme pontiff, also has a figurative and representative person of the one universal Church. |
| 157 | Unde Augustinus super Ioannem et super illo verbo: «Tu vocaberis Cephas», ait Sermone 7: «Magnum, quia mutavit ei nomen et fecit de Simone Petrum. | Hence Augustine, in his sermon on John and on the word "You shall be called Cephas," says in Sermon 7: "It is great, because he changed his name and made Simon Peter. |
| 157 | Petrus autem a petra, petra vero ecclesia. | But Peter is from rock, and rock is indeed the Church. |
| 157 | Ergo in Petri nomine figurata est ecclesia. | Therefore, the Church is figured in the name of Peter. |
| 157 | » Idem Sermone 11 et Sermone ultimo, ubi, dum de ecclesia loqueretur, Augustinus dicit: «Cuius ecclesiae Petrus apostolus propter apostolatus sui primatum gerebat figurata generalitate personam. | The same Augustine says in Sermon 11 and his last sermon, where, while speaking about the Church, Augustine says: "The apostle Peter bore the figure of the Church in general because of the primacy of his apostleship. |
| 157 | Quod enim ad ipsum proprie pertinet, natura unus homo erat, gratia unus Christianus, abundantiore gratia unus idemque primus apostolus. | For what pertains to him properly, he was one man by nature, one Christian by grace, and the first apostle by more abundant grace. |
| 157 | Sed quando ei dictum est: Tibi dabo claves regni caelorum, et quodcumque ligaveris etc. | But when it was said to him: "I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind," etc. |
| 157 | , universam significabat ecclesiam, unde Petrus accepit nomen. | he signified the whole Church, from which Peter received his name. |
| 157 | Non enim a Petro petra, sed Petrus a petra, sicut non Christus a Christiano, sed Christianus a Christo. | For it is not from Peter that rock comes, but Peter from rock, just as it is not from Christian that Christ comes, but Christian from Christ. |
| 157 | Ideo proprie ait dominus: Super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam, quia dixerat Petrus: Tu es Christus, filius dei vivi. | Therefore, the Lord properly says: "On this rock I will build my Church," because Peter had said: "You are Christ, the Son of the living God." |
| 157 | Super ergo hanc petram, quam confessus es, aedificabo ecclesiam meam. | Therefore, on this rock, which you have confessed, I will build my Church. |
| 157 | Petra autem erat Christus, supra quod fundamentum etiam ipse aedificatus est Petrus. | Now the rock was Christ, on which foundation Peter himself was also built. |
| 157 | Ecclesia autem quae fundatur a Christo claves ab eo regni caelorum accepit in Petro, id est potestatem ligandi et solvendi peccata. | But the Church, which is founded by Christ, received from him the keys of the kingdom of heaven in Peter, that is, the power of binding and loosing sins. |
| 157 | Quod autem per proprietatem in Christo ecclesia, hoc est per significationem Petrus in petra, qua significatione intelligitur Christus petra, Petrus ecclesia. | But what the Church is in Christ by property, this Peter is in rock by signification, by which signification Christ is understood to be the rock, and Peter the Church. |
| 157 | » Haec ille. | These are his words. |
| 157 | Et pro hoc textus Augustini 11 q. | And for this, Augustine's text, question 11, chapter 3, and Leo, chapter 19, say the same. |
| 157 | 3 Illud et Leo 19 di. | Thus the Lord and the Archdeacon, question 24, chapter 1, say: "Whatever you bind," etc. |
| 157 | Ita Dominus et Archidiaconus 24 q. | Whoever, chapter 21, and Decretals, On Penance, chapter 2, section: "If he is," etc. |
| 157 | 1 Quodcumque et c. | Peter and Augustine, On the Agony of the Christian, chapter 20, and in the Homily on the Transfiguration, and On the Words of the Lord, book 1, Sermon 13, and Sermon 13 on the Apostles Peter and Paul, and book 2 of Questions on the Old and New Testaments, question 79, and book of Homilies, Homily 46, and on Psalm 108, Sermon 13, and Ambrose, On the Care of the Pastor, and Anselm on the word of Matthew: "For you will always have the poor with you." |
| 157 | Quicumque, 21 di. | And since this is so, that Peter is from rock and rock is the Church, which signifies Christ, and because of this, it is his mystical body, therefore it is clear how Christ is truth, rock – the figure or signification of Christ – Church, and the figure or signification of this rock is Peter. |
| 157 | Decretis, De poenitentia di. | Whence, just as Christ is truth, whose figure and signification is rock or Church, so rock is truth, whose signification and figure is Peter. |
| 157 | 2 § Si es v. | From which it clearly appears that the Church is above Peter, just as Christ is above the Church. |
| 157 | Petrus et Augustinus De agone Christiano c. | Rightly, just as we say that the Old Testament is a figure of the New, and the New Testament is truth with respect to the Old, and thus the New Testament is a figure of glory, where there is only truth, so the Catholic Church is truth and figure: truth with respect to what is inferior, figure with respect to what is superior. |
| 157 | 20 et in Homilia de transfiguratione et De verbis Domini libro 1 Sermone 13 et Sermone 13 de &laddapostolis&radd Petro et Paulo et libro 2 Quaestionum veteris et novi testamenti quaestione 79 et libro Homiliarum Homilia 46 et in Psalmo 108 Sermone 13 et Ambrosius De cura pastorali et Anselmus super illo verbo Matthaei: «Nam pauperes semper habetis vobiscum». | Then it is clear from this that, just as Peter uniquely and confusedly figures the Church, who is changeable, then there are many degrees of representations and significations between rock and Peter, until one arrives at rock from a confused representation and figure to truth through more certain and truer means. |
| 157 | Et quoniam hoc ita est quod Petrus a petra et petra ecclesia quae significat Christum, et propter hoc est corpus eius mysticum, ideo patet, quomodo Christus est veritas, petra – figura sive significatio Christi – ecclesia, huius autem petrae figura sive significatio Petrus. | But one Church can only be signified and represented by one congregation, which the Greeks call a synod. |
| 157 | Unde sicut Christus est veritas, cuius figura et significatio est petra sive ecclesia, ita petra est veritas, cuius significatio et figura est Petrus. | From which it happens that in universal synods it should be considered whether there is an ordained congregation, which from a synodic union has the power to represent the universal Church, for example, from the pope, patriarchs, and provincial heads. |
| 157 | Ex quo clare patet ecclesiam supra Petrum esse, sicut supra illam est Christus. | Whence, when a universal synod is thus gathered in an orderly manner, there is no doubt that the judgment of that synod, the less confused it is, the more it tends towards truth, and the more it tends towards infallibility, and it is always greater than the judgment of a single Roman pontiff, who figures it in a confused manner. |
| 157 | Recte, sicut dicimus vetus testamentum esse figuram novi et novum testamentum esse veritatem in ordine ad vetus, et sic supra vetus, et novum esse figuram gloriae, ubi sola veritas, sic novum testamentum est veritas et figura: veritas respectu inferioris, figura respectu superioris, sic et ecclesia catholica. | It is an ancient proverb that what is sought by many is more easily found. |
| 158 | Deinde ex hoc patet quod, sicut Petrus unice et confusissime figurat ecclesiam, qui deviabilis est, quod tunc inter petram et Petrum sunt plures graduationes repraesentationum et significationum, quousque in petram deveniatur a confusissima repraesentatione et figura usque in veritatem per media certiora et veriora. | Therefore, the judgment of the pope should be presumed to be less stable and more fallible than that of the pope and others together, and this is not doubtful. |
| 158 | Unam autem ecclesiam significare et repraesentare non potest nisi unus aut una congregatio, quam Graeci synodum dicunt. | And the preceding points seem to be proven by the 62nd epistle of Saint Ambrose, which is of the Roman pontiff and not of Ambrose, as is proven from the epistle itself, having regard to the immediately preceding one. |
| 158 | Ex quo evenit quod in synodis universalibus considerari debet, an sit ordinata congregatio, quae ex unione synodica repraesentare habeat universalem ecclesiam, puta ex papa, patriarchis et provinciarum capitibus. | For the 61st epistle of Ambrose to Theophilus begins: "Evagrius has nothing to urge, and Flavianus has something to fear, and therefore he avoids examination," and below: "Grant, brothers, a just pardon to our sorrow, because the whole world is shaken on account of them, and yet they do not sympathize with our sorrow," and below: "A great discord stood in the whole world. |
| 158 | Unde, quando ita iuxta praemissa supra contingit universalem synodum ordinate congregari, non dubium, quanto illa synodus minus confuse plus tendendo in veritatem repraesentat, tanto eius iudicium plus a fallibilitate versus infallibilitatem tendit et semper maius est iudicio unici Romani pontificis confusissime figurantis. | To which the holy synod of Capua finally offered a port of tranquility, so that communion of the Catholic faith might be given to all throughout the East, and your examination might be imparted to our brothers and fellow priests of Egypt, sitting together equally, because we considered this to be a true judgment," and below: "We certainly think that it should be referred to our holy brother, the priest of the Roman Church, because we presume that you will judge those things which will not displease him either," and below: "So it will be a useful consultation of opinion, so the security of peace and quiet, if it is established by your council," and below: "What the Roman Church has undoubtedly approved, we gladly approve the fruit of this examination." |
| 158 | Antiquum est hoc proverbium facilius inveniri, quod a pluribus quaeritur. | After this, the epistle follows, in which is the response of the pope himself to the writings of those judges deputed by the council, according to what Ambrose consulted, which he ought to have required. |
| 158 | Quare papae iudicium minus stabile et magis fallibile praesumi quam ipsius et aliorum, et hoc non habet dubium. | And at the beginning, the pope says, whose name, however, I did not find in my codex, that they had inquired about his opinion concerning Bishop Bonosus, and below: "We notice that the form of judging does not pertain to us," and below: "For if the synod were intact today, we would rightly judge concerning those things which are contained in the series of your writings," and below: "It is yours, therefore, who have received this judgment, to pronounce a sentence on all things," and below: "For you have received the role of the synod, whom the synod elected to examine," and below: "Finally, when Bishop Bonosus, after your judgment, had sent to our brother Ambrose, who was to consult his opinion, that he was forbidden to break into and enter the Church, it was responded to him that nothing should be done rashly, but all things should be done modestly, patiently, and in order," and below: "So that you might establish what seems to you to be in accordance with justice, to whom this synod has given authority," and below in the end: "Therefore, we await the norm of your sentence." |
| 159 | Et praemissa videntur probari ex 62 epistula sancti Ambrosii, quae est Romani pontificis et non Ambrosii, ut ex ipsamet epistula habendo respectum ad immediate praecedentem probatur. | These are his words. |
| 159 | Est enim 61 epistula Ambrosii ad Theophilum, quae incipit: «Non habet quod urgeat Evagrius, et habet quod metuat Flavianus, ideoque refugit examen. | Behold, the pope confesses that if the synod were intact, that is, if he had not committed the judgment to others, he himself could have judged the case. |
| 159 | Dent fratres dolori iusto veniam, quia propter ipsos universus orbis concutitur, et illi tamen nostro non compatiuntur dolori», et infra: «Gravis toto orbe stabat discordia. | But because the synod committed it to others, he says that he cannot and that it does not pertain to him by the authority of the synod. |
| 159 | Cui bonae pacis naufragio sancta synodus Capuensis tandem obtulerat portum tranquillitatis, ut omnibus per totum orientem daretur communio catholicam confitentibus fidem, et duobus istis tuae sanctitatis examen impertiretur fratribus et consacerdotibus nostris Aegyptiis pariter consedentibus, quia hoc verum iudicium arbitrati sumus», et infra: «Sane referendum arbitramur ad sanctum fratrem nostrum Romanae sacerdotem ecclesiae, quoniam praesumimus te ea iudicaturum, quae etiam illi displicere non queant. | Which is to be noted, because from this it is clearly proven that the authority of the synod is above the pope, and also that the commissioners of the synod, bearing the role of the whole synod, are preferred to the pope in what has been committed to them. |
| 159 | Ita enim erit utile consultum sententiae, ita pacis et quietis securitas, si id vestro statuatur concilio», et infra: «Quod ecclesia Romana haud dubio comprobaverit, laeti fructum huiusmodi examinis comprobamus». | I believe that this pope was Saint Damasus, who wrote this response, because, as is found in the immediately following epistle 63, Damasus was then in those times, where Ambrose says: "For even two years ago, Saint Damasus, the priest of the Roman Church, elected by the judgment of God, sent to me," etc. |
| 159 | Post hoc sequitur epistula, in qua est responsio ipsius papae ad scripta illorum iudicum a concilio deputatorum, secundum quod consuluit Ambrosius, quod ipse requiri deberet. | **The epistle that follows is the response of the pope to the writings of the judges deputed by the council, according to what Ambrose consulted. |
| 159 | Et in principio dicit papa, cuius tamen nomen in meo codice non repperi, quod pro veritate vel modestia de Bonoso episcopo suam sententiam sciscitarentur, et infra: «Advertimus quod nobis iudicandi forma competere non potest. | The pope begins by saying that they had inquired about his opinion concerning Bishop Bonosus, and then states that the form of judging does not pertain to him. |
| 159 | Nam si integra esset synodus hodie, recte de hiis quae comprehendit vestrorum scriptorum series, iudicaremus. | The pope notes that if the synod were intact, he would rightly judge concerning the matters at hand. |
| 159 | Vestrum est ergo, qui hoc recepistis iudicium, sententiam ferre de omnibus», et infra: «Vicem enim synodi recepistis, quos ad examinandum synodus elegit. | The pope affirms that the role of the synod has been received by those who were elected to examine. |
| 159 | Denique cum Bonosus episcopus post iudicium vestrum misisset ad fratrem nostrum Ambrosium, qui eius sententiam consuleret interdictam sibi ecclesiam inrumpere atque ingredi, responsum est ei, quod nihil temerandum foret, sed omnia modeste, patienter, ordine gerenda: neque contra sententias vestras tentandum aliquod, ut, quod videretur vobis iustitiae convenire, statueretis, quibus hanc synodus dederat auctoritatem. | The pope responds to Bishop Bonosus, who had sent to Ambrose to consult his opinion, that nothing should be done rashly, but all things should be done modestly, patiently, and in order. |
| 159 | Ideo primum est, ut hii iudicent, quibus iudicandi facultas est data. | The pope states that the first consideration is that those who have the faculty of judging should judge. |
| 159 | Vos enim totius, ut scripsimus, synodi vice decernitis, nos quasi ex synodi auctoritate iudicare non convenit», et infra in fine: «Unde vestrae normam exspectamus sententiae». | The pope notes that they are deciding in place of the whole synod, and that it is not fitting for him to judge by the authority of the synod. |
| 159 | Haec ibi. | The pope concludes by saying that they await the norm of the sentence. |
| 160 | Ecce papam fateri, si integra foret synodus, hoc est, si non commisisset iudicium aliis, ipse de causa iudicare potuisset. | Behold, the pope confesses that if the synod were intact, he himself could have judged the case. |
| 160 | Sed quia synodus commisit aliis, dicit se non posse et ex auctoritate synodi sibi non convenire. | But because the synod committed it to others, he says that he cannot and that it does not pertain to him by the authority of the synod. |
| 160 | Quod est notandum, quoniam ex hoc clare probatur auctoritatem synodi supra papam esse et etiam commissarios synodi vicem totius synodi gerentes papae in commisso praeferri. | This is to be noted, because from this it is clearly proven that the authority of the synod is above the pope, and also that the commissioners of the synod are preferred to the pope in what has been committed to them. |
| 160 | Fuit, credo, ille papa sanctus Damasus, qui hanc rescripsit, quoniam, ut ex immediate sequenti epistula 63 habetur, tunc Damasus illis temporibus fuit, ubi dicit Ambrosius: «Nam et ante biennium misit ad me sanctus Damasus, Romanae ecclesiae sacerdos, iudicio dei electus etc. | I believe that this pope was Saint Damasus, who wrote this response, because, as is found in the immediately following epistle 63, Damasus was then in those times. |
| 161 | Quare concluditur universale concilium rite adunatum, licet graduationes inter se habere possit quoad iudicia, est tamen semper maioris auctoritatis et minoris fallibilitatis quam papae tantum. | Therefore, a universal council, properly convened, although it may have differing judgments among its members, is nonetheless always of greater authority and less fallible than the pope alone. |
| 161 | Ex quo sequitur corollarie universale concilium etiam in alio quam haeresis casu deponere posse, sicut hoc etiam de Benedicto XII et Ioanne XXIII legitur. | From this it follows, by corollary, that a universal council can also depose a pope in a case other than heresy, as is also read concerning Benedict XII and John XXIII. |
| 161 | Et hoc probatur ex c. | And this is proven from c. |
| 161 | 1 De renuntiatione Libro Sexto, quia si papalitas ab hoc subiecto materiali, scilicet isto homine, est iudicio ipsius papae, dum se inutilem iudicat, removibilis, ut ibidem, et hic habetur maioris auctoritatis esse concilii iudicium quam papae tantum et minus fallibile, tunc clarum est quod, sicut papa tunc potest ex causa legitima cessare ab administratione, ita etiam subiecti communi concilio possent ex eisdem causis in praestando oboedientiam cessare, quando inutiliter administraret. | 1 On Renunciation in Book Six, because if the papacy is removable from this material subject, namely this man, by the judgment of the pope himself, when he judges himself unfit, as is there stated, then the judgment of the council is of greater authority and less fallible than that of the pope alone.  Thus, just as a pope can cease from administration for a legitimate reason, so too can subjects cease from obedience to him for the same reasons, when he administers in an ineffective manner. |
| 161 | Dum enim praelatus eligitur, eligitur, ut praeessendo prosit, 1 q. | For when a prelate is chosen, he is chosen, so that by presiding he may benefit, |
| 161 | 1 § Ecce cum honore, 8 q. | 1 § Behold with honor, |
| 161 | 1 Qui episcopatum, 28 q. | 1 Who the episcopate, |

| 161 | 4 Quisquis. | 4 Whoever. |
| 161 | Unde, quando inutilis est, tunc condicio tacita, secundum quam consensus intervenit, et cessante causa, propter quam electio facta est, praestant illam auctoritatem sic ipsi concilio a fortiori, quamquam seipsum in illo capitulo primo papa habere dicit. | Therefore, when he is useless, then the tacit condition, according to which consent intervenes, and the cause for which the election was made ceases, confers that authority to the council all the more, although the pope himself claims to have it in that first chapter. |
| 161 | Et non habet aliquis ratione utens in hoc dubium, quin maior sit potestas ipsius concilii ecclesiam repraesentantis in papalitatem, ut secundum utilitatem ecclesiae materiale eius subiectum disponatur, quam in iudicio unius hominis in ipsam papalitatem sibi nomine ecclesiae et propter ipsam adiunctam. | And no one using reason can doubt that the power of the council representing the Church in the papacy, so that the material subject of the papacy is disposed of according to the utility of the Church, is greater than the judgment of one man in the papacy itself, which is attached to him in the name of the Church and for the Church's sake. |
| 162 | Posset forte dubium esse, an concilium exercitium administrationis a vero et unico papa ad tempus vel ad beneplacitum tollere posset, non propter impotentiam concilii, sed propter rei contradictionem, cum ex superioribus pateat et etiam inferioribus papatum in libera administrandi potestate tantum consistere; unde illa sublata videtur papatus sublatus. | It might perhaps be doubted whether a council could remove the exercise of administration from a true and unique pope for a time or at his pleasure, not because of the council's impotence, but because of the contradiction of the matter, since from the above and also from the below it is clear that the papacy consists only in the free power of administering; whence that being removed, the papacy seems removed. |
| 162 | Tamen, quia in Constantiensi et isto Basiliensi concilio certa decreta sunt contra papam edita sub suspensionis poena, negare non possum papam suspendi posse, licet ego prima fronte non vellem negare illa suspensione non obstante in foro conscientiae absolutum, ubi est propria superna potestas papae, quamdiu papa est, vere absolutum esse et ad illam potestatem hanc suspensionem extendi non debere, quia illa videtur divinitus papatui annexa, licet praeter illam potestatem omni alia, quae a iure vel homine aut foro extrinseco dependit, quoad exercitium careat. | However, because in the Council of Constance and this one of Basel certain decrees were issued against the pope under penalty of suspension, I cannot deny that a pope can be suspended, although I would not wish to deny at first that, notwithstanding that suspension, he is absolved in the forum of conscience, where the pope's own supreme power, as long as he is pope, is truly absolute and this suspension should not extend to that power, because that seems divinely annexed to the papacy, although apart from that power, it lacks all other power that depends on law or man or an external forum, as regards its exercise. |
| 162 | Verum si concilium expresse exercitium ligandi et solvendi ab eo etiam in foro poenitentiali per suspensionem tollere vellet, tunc oporteret dicere aut ipsum depositum pro tunc, aut quid aliud esse papatum quam liberam administrationem super omnes ligandi et solvendi, quod praedictis contradiceret et novum esset. | But if the council expressly wished to remove the exercise of binding and loosing from him even in the penitential forum by suspension, then one would have to say either that the papacy is deposited for that time, or what else is the papacy than the free administration over all binding and loosing, which would contradict the foregoing and be something new. |
| 163 | Ex hiis et superius tactis manifestum est, quia quisque praesidens figurata generalitate subditos figurat modo, quo papa confusissime totam ecclesiam, propinquiore autem modo suum patriarchatum, adhuc propinquiore suam metropolim, adhuc certiori suam dioecesim, adhuc certiori suum clerum, et ultimo quasi in uno corpore suum quotidianum concilium figurat. | From these things and the above-mentioned, it is manifest that each president, by a figurative generality, figures subjects in the manner in which the pope most confusedly figures the whole Church, but more closely his patriarchate, still more closely his metropolis, still more certainly his diocese, still more certainly his clergy, and finally, as if in one body, his daily council. |
| 163 | Unde evenit, ut cardinales aut legati provinciarum, qui assistunt Romano pontifici, principalia membra et pars corporis papae dicantur. | Hence it comes about that cardinals or legates of provinces who assist the Roman pontiff are called the principal members and part of the pope's body. |
| 163 | Deinde etiam est ex hoc manifestum quod quanto particularior est praesidentia, tanto certior repraesentatio, quae apud ipsum praesidentem est et minus confusa. | Then also it is manifest from this that the more particular the presidency, the more certain the representation that is in the president and the less confused. |
| 163 | Unde propter hoc, quia, ut dicit Hieronymus ad Rusticum, 7 q. | Therefore, because, as Jerome says to Rusticus, |
| 163 | 1 In apibus, omnis ordo ecclesiasticus rectoribus utitur, in quibus demum ad unum devenitur, isti autem rectores per consensum iure divino et naturali constitui deberent, et ut Anicius papa dixit, tunc oportet, ut qui omnibus praeesse debet, ab omnibus eligatur, 66 di. | 1 In bees, every ecclesiastical order uses rulers, in whom finally one is reached; these rulers, however, should be constituted by divine and natural law through consent, and as Pope Anicius said, then it is necessary that he who ought to preside over all should be chosen by all, |
| 163 | Archiepiscopus, et quod nullus detur invitis, ut infra dicetur, quoniam secundum sanctum Leonem nulla ratio sinit, ut inter episcopos habeatur non-electus. | Archbishop, and that none should be given against their will, as will be said below, because, according to Saint Leo, no reason permits that there be a non-elected person among the bishops. |
| 164 | Ad hoc enim, ut unum corpus in concordantia constituatur ex subiectis et praesidente, ratio et naturale ius simul et divinum exigunt in hac spirituali unione matrimoniali consensum mutuum, quem ex omnium electione et electi consensu deprehendimus, recte sicut inter Christum et ecclesiam spirituale matrimonium ex consensu constituitur, ut 7 q. | For this, in order that one body be constituted in concordance from subjects and president, reason and natural and divine law together demand in this spiritual matrimonial union mutual consent, which we find from the election of all and the consent of the elected, just as the spiritual marriage between Christ and the Church is constituted by consent, as in |
| 164 | 1 Sicut et aliis capitulis ibidem et similibus multis 62 et 63 di. | 1 As in other chapters there and in many similar ones, |

| 165 | Unde quando sub poena excommunicationis latae sententiae canon 26 octavi concilii universalis statuit patriarchale iudicium pro firmo servari debere, dicit iustum rationabile et sine suspicione esse eo, quod apud eum honorabiliores quique colligantur. | Therefore, when under penalty of excommunication latae sententiae the canon 26 of the eighth universal council decreed that the patriarchal judgment should be firmly observed, it says that it is just, reasonable, and without suspicion, because the most honorable are gathered there. |
| 165 | Et non dixit canon de cardinalibus Romanis, quoniam, ut colligitur ex canone Praesul iuncto c. | And the canon did not say about the Roman cardinals, because, as is gathered from the canon Praesul joined with c. |

| 166 | Sed textus praeallegatus loquitur de metropolitanis et legatis provinciarum, qui ad patriarchale concilium iuxta canonem 17 tenebantur concurrere. | But the aforementioned text speaks of metropolitans and legates of the provinces, who were obliged to assemble at the patriarchal council according to Canon 17. |
| 166 | Quare in finem universalis boni regiminis, quia plena universalia concilia difficulter colliguntur, hanc putarem primam radicem reformationis, ut cardinales ex legatis provinciarum constituerentur, quorum concilio cuncta gravia aut ordinationi universali canonum obvia cum subscriptione tam papae quam cardinalium expedirentur, ut ex subscriptione certa scientia et strictum examen intervenisse videretur, ut sic debita canonibus servaretur reverentia et nihilominus utilitati et necessitati in particulari casu succurreretur. | Therefore, for the sake of the good governance of the universal Church, since full universal councils are difficult to convene, I would consider this the first root of reform: that cardinals be constituted from the legates of the provinces, by whose council all weighty matters or those pertaining to universal canonical order might be resolved with the subscription of both the pope and the cardinals, so that from the subscription it might appear that certain knowledge and strict examination had intervened, thus preserving due reverence for the canons while still addressing utility and necessity in particular cases. |
| 166 | Funguntur enim cardinales vice metropolitanorum, 23 di. | For the cardinals act in place of the metropolitans, 23rd Distinction. |
| 166 | In nomine Domini, et notat Hostiensis in Summa De poenitentia et remissionibus § Cui papa v. | In the name of the Lord, and Hostiensis notes in his *Summa* on Penance and Remissions, under the section *Cui papa* (v.). |
| 166 | Alii dicunt. | Others say. |
| 166 | Igitur sicut metropolitani provinciarum per electionem provincialium constituuntur, ita et cardinales, qui eorum vices gerunt, iuxta praenarrata constitui debent. | Therefore, just as the metropolitans of the provinces are constituted through the election of the provincials, so too the cardinals, who exercise their office, ought to be constituted according to the aforementioned. |
| 166 | Et maxime hoc tempore istud necessarium foret, quoniam non sicut antiquitus metropolitani et episcopi, quamquam forte iurent, adhuc ex forma antiqua, ut c. | And especially in this time, this would be necessary, since unlike in antiquity, metropolitans and bishops—though they perhaps swear according to the ancient form, as in the canon *Episcopi* and the following (93rd Distinction)—do not convene annually to the pope. |
| 166 | Episcopi et sequens 93 di. | Bishops and the following (canon), 93rd Distinction. |
| 166 | , annuatim ad papam conveniunt. | They convene annually to the pope. |
| 166 | Quorum consilio solebant Romani pontifices in decidendis arduis uti. | By whose counsel the Roman pontiffs were accustomed to decide difficult matters. |
| 166 | Et fuit huiusmodi observanti adeo stricta praesertim de metropolitanis, ut legitur in 17 canone octavi concilii universalis, quod ipsi etiam neque propter duas synodos provinciales neque principum saecularium vocationem poterant excusari, hodie autem, etiam si in curia forent Romana, tamquam alieni ad concilium papae non vocantur. | And this practice was so strictly observed, particularly concerning metropolitans, as is read in Canon 17 of the Eighth Universal Council: that even they could not be excused on account of two provincial synods or the summons of secular princes. Today, however, even if they were in the Roman Curia, they are not called to the pope’s council as outsiders. |
| 166 | Quod absurdum est, maxime quando universalis ecclesiae casus aliquis vel alius quoquo modo ecclesiam universalem respiciens tractatur. | This is absurd, especially when some case of the universal Church or another matter in any way concerning the universal Church is being treated. |
| 166 | Quare necesse foret tales legatos provinciarum cardinales constitui ex multis utilibus causis, quas quisque intelligens facile concipit, qui cursum Romanae curiae aliqualiter cognoscit. | Therefore, it would be necessary for such legates of the provinces to be constituted as cardinals for many useful reasons, which any discerning person familiar with the workings of the Roman Curia can easily grasp. |
| 167 | Capitulum XIX. | Chapter XIX. |
| 167 | Si iura ac dicta sanctorum patrum, quae loquuntur nullum ad praesidentialem curam ordinari debere nisi electum ab hiis, quibus praesidere debet, &laddservarentur&radd, ut suae praesidentiae originem ab hiis se habere cognoscat, quibus praeest, et sic absque superbia in amore pascat, tunc videremus, quomodo ex ordinatis gradualibus electionibus ad hoc recte devenitur, quod superius per sanctum Augustinum dictum est, scilicet quod de petra, id est ecclesia fidelium, Petrus oritur. | If the laws and sayings of the holy fathers—which state that no one ought to be ordained to presidential care unless elected by those over whom he is to preside—were observed, so that he might recognize the origin of his presidency as deriving from those whom he governs, and thus feed them in love without pride, then we would see how through gradual elections ordained to this end, what was said above through St. Augustine is rightly achieved: namely, that Peter arises from the rock, which is the Church of the faithful. |
| 167 | Non quod potestas praesidentialis quae in praesidentibus est a populo ortum totaliter capiat, sed, sicut praehabitum est superius, tunc sacerdotium, quod est ut anima in ecclesia militanti – anima autem secundum eius motivam et sensitivam partem considerata educitur de potentia materiae, secundum autem rationalem eius partem considerata a deo est –, sic sacerdotium capit ab inferiori populo fidelium illam praesidentialem motivam, vegetativam et sensitivam potestatem – quae potestas exit de potentia materiae subditorum per voluntariam subiectionem –, a deo autem per sacramenta capit potestatem rationabilis animae, quae desursum venit, ut sic possit in dulci concordantia superna potestate per medium elicitae et traditae potestatis influere in corpus subiectorum, quae ad salutarem unionem cum Christo capite perficiunt. | Not that the presidential power existing in prelates takes its origin entirely from the people, but—as was stated above—then the priesthood, which is like the soul in the militant Church (for the soul, considered according to its motive and sensitive part, is drawn from the potentiality of matter, but considered according to its rational part, is from God), thus the priesthood receives from the lower body of the faithful that motive, vegetative, and sensitive presidential power (which power arises from the potentiality of the subjects through voluntary submission), while from God through the sacraments it receives the power of the rational soul, which comes from above, so that it may thus influence the body of subjects through the sweet concord of supernal power mediated by elicited and transmitted power, perfecting them into salutary union with Christ the Head. |
| 167 | Unde Hormisda papa episcopis Hispaniae: «Ne benedictio, quae per impositionem manus a deo esse creditur, pretio comparetur. | Hence Pope Hormisdas to the bishops of Spain: “Let not the blessing, which is believed to come from God through the imposition of hands, be purchased for a price. |
| 167 | Quis nobile putet esse, quod vendidit? | Who would consider noble that which he has sold? |
| 167 | Iustam sacerdotibus ordinandis reverentiam servet electio, ut in gravi munere populorum divinum credatur esse iudicium. | Let election preserve due reverence for those to be ordained as priests, so that in the grave duty of the people, divine judgment may be trusted. |
| 167 | Ibi enim deus, ubi simplex sine pravitate consensus. | For God is there where there is a simple consensus without corruption.” |
| 167 | » Haec ille. | These are his words. |
| 167 | Et quamquam summorum sacerdotum deiectionem sibi deus reservavit, electionem tamen eorum fideli populo concessit, 79 di. | And although God has reserved to Himself the removal of high priests, He has nevertheless granted their election to the faithful people, 79th Distinction. |
| 167 | c. | Final chapter. |

| 167 | 2 Dilectissimi. | Concerning which more will be said below. |
| 167 | De quo infra latius. | And this is a beautiful speculation: how in the people all powers—both spiritual, which lie latent in potentiality, and even temporal and corporeal—though for the actual establishment of presidential power, the formative ray from above must necessarily concur, which constitutes it in being, since all power is from above (and I speak of ordained power), just as the earth is the dregs of the elements, from whose potentiality, through celestial influence, various plants and sentient beings are drawn forth. |
| 168 | Et pulchra est haec speculatio, quomodo in populo omnes potestates tam spirituales in potentia latent quam etiam temporales et corporales, licet ad hoc, quod ipsa praesidentialis potestas in actu constituatur, necessario desuper concurrere habeat radius formativus, qui hanc constituat in esse, quoniam omnis potestas desursum est – et loquor de ordinata potestate – recte, sicut terra est faex elementorum, de cuius tamen potentia mediante influentia caelesti varia vegetabilia et sensibilia educuntur. | Therefore, not inaptly does Abbot Joachim say in his commentary on the Apocalypse that the people bear the figure of the Father, secular clergy the Son, and religious the Holy Spirit. |
| 168 | Quare non inepte abbas Ioachim super Apocalypsim dicit populum patris figuram, clericos saeculares filii et religiosos spiritus sancti gestare. | For as the Son is from the Father, so clerics are from the laity; and as the Holy Spirit proceeds from both, so religious proceed from the laity and the clerics. |
| 168 | Quoniam sicut filius a patre, ita clerici a laicis, et sicut spiritus sanctus ab utroque, ita religiosi a laicis et a clericis procedunt. | Chapter XX. |
| 169 | Capitulum XX. | To another current doubt—whether the pope can be so bound by the decrees of a universal council that he cannot act contrary to them—an answer may easily be drawn from what has been prescribed. |
| 169 | Alio currenti dubio, an ita per decreta universalis concilii papa ligari possit, quod in contrarium non possit, facile ex praescriptis potest responderi. | Since, if a universal council, properly understood, is above the pope (as stated earlier), the doubt is resolved. |
| 169 | Quoniam, si universale concilium proprie acceptatum est supra papam, ut praedictum est, solutum est dubium. | Hence, although the pope in the canon *Significasti* (On Election) and *Proposuit* (On the Granting of a Prebend) claims to be above the council and above the laws, this is true of his own general council, where he presides as patriarch, and of the laws established there or elsewhere in other particular councils or by him. Yet I admit that, on account of its primacy over all churches, the Apostolic See is bound by *epikeia* such that it cannot be removed in particular cases, since it must often dispense and interpret for the sake of utility and necessity in building up the Church, and solely for that end. |
| 169 | Unde, quamvis papa in c. | But that the pope cannot abolish or alter the canons of universal councils or enact anything contrary to them, the notable text is 25th Question, Chapter 1, *Contra statuta*, where Pope Zosimus says: “Not even the authority of this See can establish or alter anything contrary to the statutes of the Fathers.” |
| 169 | Significasti De electione supra concilium et c. | And the same Zosimus says to Aurelius and all the bishops established throughout Africa and Gaul, etc.: “When one acts against the statutes of the holy Fathers, not only is their wisdom and judgment—which they established to endure forever—assailed, but in some way injury is done to the faith itself and Catholic discipline. |
| 169 | Proposuit De concessione praebendae supra iura esse se dicat, hoc est verum de concilio generali suo, ubi ut patriarcha praesidet, et de iuribus ibi aut alias in aliis particularibus conciliis vel per eum conditis, licet ob principatum super omnes de ecclesia epikeiam fatear ita sedi apostolicae alligatam, quod tolli quoad particulares casus non possit, quoniam dispensare et interpretari habeat saepe ob utilitatem et necessitatem in aedificationem ecclesiae, et solum ad illum finem. | For what is so holy and venerable as not to deviate at all from the path of our ancestors, whose canonical statutes are like the very foundations supporting the weight of our faith?” |
| 169 | Quod autem canones universalium conciliorum tollere non possit vel mutare vel aliquid in contrarium condere, textus est notabilis 25 q. | These are his words. |
| 169 | 1 Contra statuta, ubi Zosimus papa dicit: «Contra statuta patrum aliquid condere vel mutare nec huiusmodi sedis potest auctoritas. | Against the statutes, where Pope Zosimus says: "The authority of this see cannot establish or change anything contrary to the statutes of the fathers." |
| 169 | » Et idem Zosimus Aurelio et universis episcopis per Africam, per Gallias etc. | And the same Zosimus says to Aurelius and all the bishops throughout Africa, Gaul, etc. |
| 169 | constitutis dicit: «Cum adversus statuta sanctorum patrum venitur, non tantum illorum prudentiae atque sententiae, quae in aevum victura sanxerunt, sed ipsi quodammodo fidei et catholicae disciplinae irrogatur iniuria. | He says: "When one goes against the statutes of the holy fathers, not only is their wisdom and judgment, which they established to endure forever, injured, but in some way, the faith and Catholic discipline itself are also harmed." |
| 169 | Quid enim tam sanctum et venerabile est sicut penitus non exorbitare ab itinere maiorum, quorum canonum statuta veluti quaedam fundamenta sunt ferendis fidei nostrae ponderibus? | "For what is so holy and venerable as not to deviate at all from the path of our ancestors, whose canonical statutes are like certain foundations for bearing the weight of our faith?" |
| 169 | » Haec ille. | These are his words. |
| 170 | Haec etiam probantur ex eo, quod Damasus papa ad Paulinum scribens iubebat ad fidem revertentes se subscribere debere non tantum fidei Nicaeni concilii symbolo, sed et canonibus, pro quo facit c. | This is also evidenced by the fact that Pope Damasus, in his letter to Paulinus, ordered those returning to the faith to subscribe not only to the symbol of the Council of Nicaea but also to the canons, for which he provides evidence in chapter [citation]. |
| 170 | 1, 2 et 3 100 di. | 1, 2, and 3 100 di. |
| 170 | , et quia textus supra allegatus dicit: «Contra statuta patrum, id est canones», ut est textus 20 di. | And since the text alluded to earlier states: "Contrary to the statutes of the fathers, that is, the canons," this corresponds to text 20 di. |
| 170 | De libellis. | On libels. |
| 170 | Qui textus in fine cum dicto Zosimi bene concordat, quia dicit: «Ad effectum suumque profectum sancta evangelia utiliter retinere vel credere non probatur, qui sanctorum statuta quos canones dicimus non observat. | The text at the end aligns well with Zosimus’ saying because it states: "To faithfully retain or believe in the holy gospels until their purpose is fulfilled is not proven by one who does not observe the statutes of the saints, which we call canons. |
| 170 | » Et sanctus Gregorius papa in Registro ad Ioannem, episcopum Larissenorum, in epistula quae incipit: Frater noster Adrianus, in fine dicit: «Haec enim consona sanctis patribus diffinitione sancimus, ut, qui sacris nescit oboedire canonibus, nec sacris administrare nec communionem capere sit dignus altaribus. | " And Saint Gregory the Pope, in his Register letter to John, Bishop of Larissa, beginning with: "Brother our Adrian," concludes by saying: "This is in harmony with what the holy fathers defined, that he who does not obey the sacred canons, nor administer sacred rites nor partake of communion at the altar, is not worthy. |
| 170 | » Et tales canones, qui ita ab omnibus venerari debent, in universalibus conciliis constitui oportet, 16 di. | " Such canons, which should be venerated by all, must be established in universal councils, 16 di. |
| 170 | Habeo librum, et vocantur generalia, ut de canonibus Calcedonensis concilii Gregorius in Registro ad Secundinum in epistula quae incipit: Dilectionis tuae, dicit, ubi ait: «Sancta Calcedonensis synodus usque ad diffinitionem fidei et prolationem canonum de generalibus causis locuta est; post prolationem canonum specialia certamina episcoporum sopire curavit. | I have a book, and they are called general ones, as Gregory in his Register to Secundinus states in his letter beginning: "Dear [friend]," where he says: "The Council of Chalcedon spoke up to the definition of the faith and the enumeration of canons on general matters; after enumerating special canons, it left disputes among bishops to be settled. |
| 170 | » Haec ibi. | " This is there. |
| 170 | Talia statuta universalem statum ecclesiae respicientia papam retractare non posse notat Archidiaconus 19 di. | This indicates that an archdeacon notes 19 di that the pope cannot retract statutes respecting the universal status of the church. |
| 170 | Ita Dominus in fine, facit c. | Thus, the Lord concludes, facit c. |
| 170 | Sunt quidam et alia capitula ibi posita 25 q. | There are also other chapters placed there 25 q. |
| 170 | 1. | 1. |
| 171 | Et iterum, papa pastor est hominum, cui proprie dictum est: «Pasce oves. | Again, the pope is the shepherd of men, to whom it is truly said: "Feed my sheep. |
| 171 | » Sed regulae et canones universalium conciliorum sunt editi pro correctione morum, 31 di. | " However, the rules and canons of universal councils were formulated for the correction of morals, 31 di. |
| 171 | Nicaena igitur, et illis papa oboedire tenetur et illis in pascendo uti debet, quoniam divino consultu saluberrimos canones ediderunt, ut ait Leo Quartus papa, 25 q. | Therefore, the pope must obey the Nicaean canons and others in his shepherding, since through divine counsel they promulgated salutary canons, as Leo the Fourth Pope says, 25 q. |
| 171 | 1 Ideo. | 1 Therefore. |
| 171 | Unde superaddidit concilium universale Constantiense quod, nisi oboediret, puniri possit, quia nullam sedem magis exsequi oportet uniuscuiusque synodi constitutum quam Romanam, ut ait Gelasius papa, 25 q. | Hence, the universal council of Constance added that disobedience thereof can be punished, because no synod's constitution must be followed more strictly than that of Rome, as Gelasius the Pope states, 25 q. |
| 171 | 1 Confidimus. | 1 We believe. |
| 171 | Et Leo papa, qui in octavo concilio tuba evangelicae veritatis legitur, ad Marcianum Augustum de canonibus Nicaenis loquens dicit, quod nulla possint improbitate convelli, nulla novitate violari, et addit: «In quo opere auxiliante Christo fideliter exsequendo necesse est me perseverantem exhibere famulatum, quoniam dispensatio mihi &laddcredita&radd est et ad meum tendit reatum, si paternarum regulae sanctionum, quae spiritu dei inspirante sunt conditae, me, quod absit, connivente violentur»; facit textus eiusdem Leonis, 25 q. | And Leo the Pope, who in the eighth ecumenical council speaks through the trumpet of evangelical truth, in his address to Emperor Marcian regarding the Nicaean canons says that nothing can be overturned by wickedness, nor can novelty violate them, adding: "In carrying out faithfully what Christ aids, I must show steadfast service, for it is my duty and damnation if I connive at violating the sanctions laid down by the Fathers under divine inspiration;" thus speaks Leo, 25 q. |
| 171 | 1 Quae ad perpetuam. | 1 Which concerning perpetual. |
| 171 | Et idem Leo de approbatione fidei Calcedonensis generalis concilii ad omnes directa, quae incipit: Omnem, dicit infirmum atque irritum esse, quidquid contra canones Nicaenos fit, quorum se asserit custodem. | And the same Leo, in his endorsement of the Chalcedonian general council's faith to all directly states, beginning with: "All," declaring weak and distorted to be whatever is contrary to the Nicaean canons, of which he claims guardianship. |
| 171 | Causa autem, quare non possit in contrarium, et cur eum exsequi prae ceteris oportet, quia, ut dicit textus Violatores ibidem, quia spiritu dei conditi sunt ad bonum regimen universalis ecclesiae, et hoc spiritualiter promovere spectat ad officium Romani pontificis. | The reason why one cannot act contrarily, and why he must be followed above others, is because, as the text Violators there says, these canons were formulated under divine inspiration for the universal good governance of the church, aiming spiritually to promote the duty of the Roman pontiff. |
| 171 | Unde notat Archidiaconus 19 di. | Therefore, an archdeacon notes 19 di. |
| 171 | Ita Dominus, quod papa non potest retractare statuta respicientia universalem statum ecclesiae. | Thus, the Lord, indicating that the pope cannot retract statutes respecting the universal status of the church. |
| 172 | Canon itaque universalis concilii est dux et regula regiminis et aedificationis ecclesiae, qua maxime primum architectum uti oportet, si recte sua potestate uti voluerit. | Thus, the canon of the universal council serves as the guide and rule of church governance and edification, which one must especially use first if rightly exercising power. |
| 172 | Rectiores enim et indeviabiliores regulas nemo invenire poterit quam spiritus sanctus, universalium conciliorum inspirator. | No one will find rules more upright and irreproachable than those inspired by the Holy Spirit in the councils of all. |
| 172 | Unde in gestis actione sexta octavi concilii Zacharias, Calcedonensis episcopus, dum sibi obiceretur sententia Romani pontificis, dixit: «Papae Nicolai et aliorum patriarcharum canon princeps est, et secundum illum agentes nihil faciunt extra id quod decet. | Thus, in the sixth session of the eighth council, Zacharias, Bishop of Chalcedon, while defending the judgment of the Roman pontiff, said: "Pope Nicholas and other patriarchs are the chief of canons, and acting according to them does nothing beyond what is fitting. |
| 172 | Cum vero extra hunc faciunt, sive papa Nicolaus sive alius quis, non acquiescimus», et &laddinfra&radd: «Si facta sunt haec a Nicolao cum canone, sequimur et convenimus et roboramus, et contraria illis non sapimus. | " However, if they act beyond this, whether Pope Nicholas or anyone else, we do not acquiesce," and &laddinfra&radd: "If these things were done by Nicholas with the canon, we follow and agree and strengthen; contrary to these, we know not how to act. |
| 172 | Si vero sunt facta extra ius vel canonem, non nos illa vituperamus seu proicimus, sed canon. | If, however, they were done outside the law or canon, we do not condemn nor reject them, but the canon. |
| 172 | » Haec ibi. | " This is there. |
| 172 | Unde, quando Metrophanes respondebat, non dixit papam posse supra iura, sed dicit: «In quibus est causae diversitas, aestimationis quoque ac opinionis diversitas debet accidere», et respondet quomodo secundum regulas diffinivit, quibus consuetudo obesse non potuit in contrarium allegata aliquorum, qui de laicis et etiam neophytis ad patriarchale et archiepiscopale culmen promoti fuerunt, dicens: «Liquido sunt, quia ea quae raro fiunt positas leges non subvertunt. | Hence, when Metrophanes responded, he did not say the pope could act beyond laws, but rather: "In which there is a difference of cause, there should also be a difference in estimation and opinion," and responds how, according to the defined rules, custom did not allow deviation by some promoted from lay status to patriarchal and archiepiscopal ranks, saying: "They are clear, because laws rarely enacted do not overturn established practices. |
| 172 | » Fuit enim antiquorum maxima cura in conservandis canonibus, et frequenter in principio canonum cuiuslibet synodi statutum de observandis canonibus praemittitur, ut 25 q. | " Indeed, great care was taken by ancient fathers in preserving canons, and frequently at the beginning of any synod’s statutes, a provision is made to observe the canons, as 25 q. |
| 172 | 1 A sanctis, et in canonibus Carthaginensibus legitur: «Quae vel facta vel dicta superius comprehensa sunt vel ab aliis conciliis sunt scripta, custodire nos oportet. | 1 On holy things, and in the Carthaginian canons it reads: "Whatever has been enacted or written above or by other councils must be kept. |
| 172 | Corruptor laicus communione, clericus honore privetur. | One who corrupts communion, a cleric is deprived of honor. |
| 172 | » Universi dixerunt: «Placet, placet. | " All agreed: "It is pleasing, it is pleasing. |
| 172 | » Et adhuc fortius in concilio generali tempore Martini papae, renovatoris canonum, ut dicit glossa 18 di. | " And even stronger in the general council during Pope Martin's reign, the renovator of canons, as the gloss states 18 di. |
| 172 | Propter, ante sextum universale celebrat<o> in 20 capitulo legitur, et repetitur octava actione octavi concilii universalis: «Si quis secundum sceleratos haereticos quocumque modo aut verbo aut tempore aut loco terminos transmutat illicite, quos posuerunt firmius sanctae catholicae ecclesiae patres et sanctae et universales quinque synodi, novitates temere adinvenire et fidei alterius expositiones aut typos vel leges aut diffinitiones aut libellos», et infra: «aut ordinationes vacuas et ecclesiasticae regulae incognitas», et infra: «contra pias orthodoxorum catholicae ecclesiae, id est paternas et synodales, praedicationes <... | For, before the sixth universal council celebrated in chapter 20, it reads again in the eighth ecumenical council's action: "Whoever in any way, by word or deed, time or place, alters illicitly the limits set by the holy, catholic church’s fathers and the holy and general five synods, rashly invents novelties concerning the faith’s expositions or types, laws, definitions, or writings," and further: "or unknown ecclesiastical regulations," and further: "against pious orthodox Catholic teachings, that is, paternal and synodal," this impiously acting, unless he repents, is condemned to eternal damnation, and all the people: Let it be, let it be. |
| 172 | > haec impie agens, nisi poenituerit, in saecula saeculorum sit condempnatus, et &ladddicet&radd omnis populus: Fiat, fiat. | " And Martin the Pope subscribed with others. |
| 172 | » Et Martinus papa se cum aliis subscripsit. | From which you have that he spoke of canons in universal councils, as Roman pontiffs are bound by them. |
| 172 | Ex quo habes quod de universalibus conciliis canon loquebatur, quoniam Romani pontifices ad illos obligantur. | Therefore, in universal councils subscribing to canons is recorded, just as in general councils, as previously noted. |
| 172 | Quare in universalibus conciliis canonibus se subscripsisse leguntur, sicut etiam in generalibus suis conciliis, ut superius habetur. | Therefore, in universal councils, they are read to have subscribed to the canons, as also in their general councils, as stated above. |
| 173 | Sed non dicit iste canon de omnibus canonibus et legibus et diffinitionibus patrum, sed dicit quinque universalium conciliorum, quae tunc celebrata ante tantum fuerant. | But this canon does not speak of all canons, laws, and definitions of the Fathers, but rather of the five universal councils, which had been celebrated before that time. |
| 173 | Sic Leo ad Maximum, Antiochenum patriarcham, scribit canones Nicaeni concilii inviolabiles; et quod Romani pontifices, qui ad professionem universalium conciliorum sicut et alii patriarchae tenentur, etiam ad canonum observantiam ratione illius professionis teneantur, probat textus Sancta 16 di. | Thus Leo writes to Maximus, the Antiochene patriarch, that the canons of the Nicene council are inviolable; and that Roman popes, who are bound by profession to the universal councils just as other patriarchs are, are also bound by reason of that profession to observe the canons, is proved by text Sancta 16 di. |
| 173 | , ubi ponitur forma professionis, scilicet profitetur papa octo concilia usque ad unum apicem se servaturum et, quae statuerunt et praedicaverunt, omnibus modis sequi. | Wherein the form of the profession is set forth, namely, that the pope professes to preserve all eight councils up to one summit and to follow in every way what they established and preached. |
| 173 | Hoc etiam probat textus 15 di. | This is also proved by text 15 di. |
| 173 | Sicut; et quod sanctus Gregorius in illo c. | Likewise; and that Saint Gregory understood this not only regarding faith but also canons, is proved by his text 50 di. |
| 173 | Sicut non solum de fide, sed etiam canonibus intellexit, probat textus ipsius 50 di. | Likewise, sanctity. |
| 173 | Sicut sanctitas. | The same is also proved from the profession of Leo the Ninth to Peter of Antioch, where after the seven universal councils he says: "Whatever the aforesaid seven universal councils have thought and approved, I think and approve." |
| 173 | Idem etiam probatur ex professione Leonis Noni ad Petrum Antiochenum, ubi post septem universalia concilia dicit: «Quidquid supradicta septem universalia concilia senserunt et collaudaverunt, sentio et collaudo. | And in the Panormia of Saint Ivo, Bishop of Carnot, it is written that the profession of the Roman pontiff is taken from the Book of Roman Pontiffs in the following form: "I profess diligently and earnestly to confirm and preserve intact, and to guard in the stability of their force, all canonical decrees of all our apostolic predecessors, popes, which were either synodically established and confirmed, and to condemn and reject with like judgment those or those whom they deposed or condemned." |
| 173 | » Et in Panormia sancti Ivonis, Carnotensis episcopi, scribitur professio Romani pontificis ex Libro Romanorum pontificum sub hac forma: «Profiteor diligentius et vivacius omnia decreta canonica omnium praedecessorum apostolicorum nostrorum pontificum, quae vel synodaliter statuerunt et confirmata sunt, confirmare et indiminuta conservare et, sicut ab eis statuta sunt, in sui vigoris stabilitate custodire, quaeque vel quosque abdicaverunt vel condempnaverunt, simili sententia condempnare et abiudicare. | And after this follows another profession from the Book of Pontiffs called Diurnus: "I do not intend to diminish, alter, or admit any novelty of the tradition which I have found to be handed down and preserved by my most approved predecessors, but I fervently profess to observe and venerate all that I find to be canonically handed down, as a true disciple and follower of them with all the strength of my mind." |
| 173 | » Et post hoc sequitur alia professio ex Libro pontificum qui dicitur Diurnus: «Nihil de traditione, quam a probatissimis praedecessoribus meis traditam et conservatam repperi, diminuere vel immutare vel aliquam novitatem admittere, sed ferventer ut eorum vere discipulus et sequipeda totis mentis meae conatibus, quae tradita canonice comperio, observare et venerari profiteor. | And after this follows another profession from the Book of Pontiffs called the Diurnus: "I profess to diminish, alter, or admit any novelty in the tradition which I have found handed down and preserved by my most approved predecessors, but fervently, as their true disciple and follower, with all the efforts of my mind, to observe and venerate what I find canonically handed down." |
| 174 | Ex quibus patet quod sancti antiqui Romani pontifices non ita praesumebant de sua potestate, sed fuerunt humiles etiam se purgando coram synodo sua, non universalis ecclesiae – dico synodum universalis ecclesiae esse concilium universale. | Of these &laddpurgations&radd 2 q. |
| 174 | De istis &laddpurgationibus&radd 2 q. | 4 You commanded, where the gloss compares the pope to a dean, who can purge himself before his own chapter, just as Sixtus before the synod, and so forth. |
| 174 | 4 Mandastis, ubi glossa comparat papam decano, qui se coram suo capitulo purgare potest, sicut Sixtus coram synodo, et c. | It is heard and so forth. |
| 174 | Auditum et c. | To all of us. |
| 174 | Omnibus nobis. | Rather, Pope Leo submits himself to all the penalties contained in the laws of Marcian – if he does not observe them, on account of his confirmation –, as he himself writes to Leo the Emperor regarding his agreement with the laws: "If I have transgressed them," he says, "I subject myself to the conditions of punishment, which not only the authority of the blessed memory of the prince Marcian, but also my own agreement has established." |
| 174 | Immo Leo papa submittit se omnibus poenis in legibus contentis Marciani – si non servaverit, propter suam confirmationem –, ut ipse scribit ad Leonem Augustum de sua erga leges consensione: «Si contrafecerim eis, inquit, me ultionum conditionibus subdo, quas non solum beatae memoriae &laddprincipis&radd Marciani auctoritas, sed etiam mea consensione firmavi. | From which it is understood that, when the pope subjects himself, then there is no doubt that he is bound by that judgment, as noted by the gloss in c. |
| 174 | » Ex quo habetur quod, quando papa se subicit, tunc non habet dubium eum sententia illius obligari, ut notat glossa in c. | If the pope 40 di. |
| 174 | Si papa 40 di. | , but here it is proved that the pope is subject to the laws by the consent of subscription. |
| 174 | , sed hic probatur papam ex consensu subscriptionis legibus subici. | And since it was shown above that the pope in the writings of the universal councils approves the canons, therefore he is also subject. |
| 174 | Et cum superius de professione apertum sit papam in scriptis universalium conciliorum canones approbare, igitur et subicitur. | And further, as the red text of the sixth chapter of the councils of Africa says, whoever comes against his own profession or subscription shall be deposed in the council. |
| 175 | Et ulterius, ut dicit rubrum sexti capituli conciliorum Africae, qui contra suam professionem vel subscriptionem venerit, in concilio deponatur. | And the text says: "In response to the inquiry of the bishop Gennadius, it was said by all the bishops: Whoever comes against his own profession or subscription, he shall separate himself from this assembly." |
| 175 | Et dicit textus: «Ad interrogationem Gennadii episcopi ab universis episcopis dictum est: Qui contra suam professionem vel subscriptionem venerit, ipse sese ab hoc coetu separabit. | Behold, if the pope either professes or subscribes to the statutes, if he does not observe them, he damns himself, as Pope Leo says above. |
| 175 | » Ecce, si papa aut profitetur aut subscribit se statutis, si non servat, se dampnat, ut Leo papa dicit supra. | And see the profession of Pope Leo the Fourth regarding the observance of laws to Emperor Lothair, whom he also names as a pontiff in the manner of the ancients, 10 di. |
| 175 | Et vide professionem Leonis Quarti de legum observatione ad Lotharium Augustum, quem et pontificem nominat more antiquorum, 10 di. | Of chapters. |
| 175 | De capitulis. | And from this foundation of subscription and the subscriptions of the pope above seen in his patriarchal councils, it would not be absurd to say that the pope cannot repeal or alter statutes issued synodically by the Roman Church, because he found himself to have subscribed to them just as to the statutes of the universal council of the universal Church. |
| 175 | Et ex isto fundamento subscriptionis et superius visis subscriptionibus papae in suis patriarchalibus conciliis non esset absurdum dicere papam etiam statuta synodice per ecclesiam Romanam edita tollere aut immutare non posse, quoniam ita repperi se illis subscripsisse sicut statutis universalis concilii universalis ecclesiae. | Yet regarding this matter, because even if he should not change patriarchal statutes on account of subscription, still if he did, it would not be said that such revocation or change would be of so little value as if he changed a statute of a universal council of the Catholic Church, because the pope is not bound to observe it merely by subscription, but because it comes from a higher authority above him. |
| 175 | Tamen quoad hoc refert, quia, etiam si propter subscriptionem statuta patriarchalia immutare non deberet, tamen si faceret, non esset dicendum quod ita parum valeret revocatio aut immutatio, sicut si statutum universalis concilii catholicae ecclesiae immutaret, quoniam non obligatur papa ad illius observantiam ex subscriptione tantum, sed quia ex maiori auctoritate, quae supra ipsum est, prodiit. | Therefore, it must be said more strongly that he is subject to universal canons to which Roman pontiffs have subscribed through their legates. |
| 175 | Fortius ergo dicendum est quod canonibus universalibus subsit, quibus se Romani pontifices per suos legatos subscripserunt. | The text does well 2 q. |
| 175 | Facit bene textus 2 q. | 7 We if, which sufficiently proves with § Likewise Jerome, and § Likewise Symmachus, who § against § Hence also 17 di. |
| 175 | 7 Nos si, qui hoc satis probat cum § Item Hieronymus, et § Item Symmachus, qui § contra § Hinc etiam 17 di. | seems to say that Symmachus was stripped of his dignity in his Roman synod. |
| 175 | videtur dicere, quod Symmachus in Romana synodo sua dignitate fuit spoliatus. | And this was true in fact, but he was restored, because he could not be, according to § Hence also 17 di. |
| 175 | Et hoc fuit verum de facto, sed restitutus, quia non poterat iuxta § Hinc etiam 17 di. | And these things in the original acts, as solemnly and elegantly dictated by the deacon Ennodius about that council, can be seen. |
| 175 | Et ista in originalibus gestis per Ennodium diaconum solempniter et eleganter dictatis de illo concilio videri poterunt. | The text makes this clear also c. |
| 175 | Facit ad praedicta etiam c. | the following there. |
| 175 | sequens ibidem. | And this subjection, namely that the Roman pontiff is subject to the universal council of the Church, we understand from another source, because the legates of the apostolic see, who are said to have been in the universal councils, when they spoke to the council, are said to have risen, like Saint Peter, who rose in the council of Jerusalem, when he spoke, as a sign of subjection and reverence. |
| 175 | Et hanc subiectionem, scilicet quod Romanus pontifex subsit concilio universalis ecclesiae, ex alio deprehendimus, quia legati apostolicae sedis, qui leguntur in universalibus conciliis fuisse, dum ad concilium loquerentur, ad instar sancti Petri, qui surrexit in concilio Hierosolymorum, dum loqueretur, in signum subiectionis et reverentiae, surrexisse leguntur. | Thus it is read in the sixth universal council celebrated in Constantinople in the first session: "And those who held the place of the Roman apostolic see rose." |
| 175 | Sic legitur in sexto universali concilio Constantinopoli celebrato in prima actione: «Et exsurgentes, qui locum tenebant apostolicae sedis Romae. | Likewise, and in other councils it is read in the same way. |
| 175 | » Similiter et in aliis conciliis ita legitur. | Similarly, it is read in other councils. |
| 176 | Similiter invenitur epistulas et scripturas Romanorum pontificum ad concilium missas universale concilium examinasse. | Similarly, it is found that the universal council examined the letters and writings of the Roman pontiffs sent to the council. |
| 176 | In tertia actione octavi concilii lecta epistula Adriani papae a concilio vicarii senioris Romae interrogarunt, an canonice et synodice facta fuisset epistula. | In the third act of the eighth council, when the letter of Pope Adrian was read, the council questioned the senior vicar of Rome whether the letter had been canonically and synodically composed. |
| 176 | Sancta synodus dixit: «Canonica et ordinata et plena iustitia est epistula, quae lecta est sanctissimi papae Adriani. | The holy synod said: "The letter which has been read, of the most holy Pope Adrian, is canonical, orderly, and full of justice." |
| 176 | » Et Metrophanes, deo amicissimus episcopus Smyrnae, surgens dixit: «Cognovimus sanctissimi papae Romani sollertem locutionem et pudorem, quem in divinis et circa divinorum canonum custodiam et observantiam habet. | And Metrophanes, bishop of Smyrna, most friendly to God, rising up, said: "We have recognized the skillful speech and the modesty of the most holy Roman pontiff, which he possesses in divine matters and concerning the guarding and observance of divine canons." |
| 176 | » Et Nicolaus papa ad imperatorem Michaelem dicit hanc sanctam apostolicam ecclesiam caput omnium ecclesiarum, quae semper sanctorum patrum sincerissimas auctoritates in omnibus actibus sequitur. | And Pope Nicholas says to the Emperor Michael that this holy apostolic church is the head of all churches, which always follows the most sincere authorities of the holy fathers in all its acts. |
| 176 | Et habetur in eodem concilio octavo actione quarta et consequenter in epistula Nicolai papae ad Photium quae incipit: Postquam, quae ibidem habetur. | And it is found in the same eighth council, in the fourth act, and consequently in the letter of Pope Nicholas to Photius, which begins: "After," which is contained there. |
| 176 | In qua, postquam Nicolaus papa primatum apostolicae sedis deducit, et quod ex illo primatu Romano pontifici immineat pro omnibus qui Christi censentur nomine, cura, cuius rationem in aeterno examine reddere habet, subiungit, quomodo universitas credentium a Romana ecclesia doctrinam requirit et &laddintegritatem&radd fidei deposcit et criminum solutionem, qui dei gratia digni sunt, quoniam caput ecclesiarum est, a qua rectitudinem atque ordinem in cunctis utilitatibus atque ecclesiasticis institutionibus omnes ecclesiae exquirunt, quia ipsa Romana ecclesia canonicas et synodicas sanctorum patrum sanctiones inviolabiliter atque irrefragabiliter retinet et ex hinc est, quod eius iudicium firmum est. | In which, after Pope Nicholas deduces the primacy of the apostolic see, and that from that primacy there rests upon the Roman pontiff the care for all who are counted in the name of Christ, for which he must give an account in eternal judgment, he adds how the universality of believers requires doctrine from the Roman Church and demands the integrity of the faith and the resolution of crimes, those who are worthy by God's grace, because it is the head of the churches, from which all churches seek rectitude and order in all utilities and ecclesiastical institutions, because the Roman Church itself inviolably and irrefragably retains the canonical and synodical sanctions of the holy fathers, and hence it is that its judgment is firm. |
| 176 | Ecce, ex hoc habes causam firmitatis apostolici Romani iudicii ex inviolabilium canonum irrefragabili observantia esse. | Behold, from this you have the reason for the firmness of the Roman apostolic judgment being from the irrefragable observance of inviolable canons. |
| 176 | Sic idem in concilio suo ex tota Romana ecclesia congregato capitulo 6 dicit: «Quoniam oportet nos maiorum nostrorum, immo toto mentis intuitu conservare et in omnibus sanctorum patrum semper dogmata venerari», et habetur actione septima. | Thus the same, in his council gathered from the whole Roman church, says in chapter 6: "Because it is necessary for us to preserve the traditions of our ancestors, indeed with the whole intent of our minds, and in all things always to venerate the dogmas of the holy fathers," and it is found in the seventh act. |
| 176 | Et in isto fundantur textus eiusdem Nicolai, 9 q. | And on this are based the texts of the same Nicholas, 9 q. |
| 176 | 3 Patet, 17 q. | 3 Patet, 17 q. |
| 176 | 4 Nemini, qui dicit sententiam papae a nemine retractari posse. | 4 Nemini, who says that the sentence of the pope cannot be retracted by anyone. |
| 176 | Sed si iniusta esset, retractaretur, et in dubio examinatur per universale concilium. | But if it were unjust, it would be retracted, and in doubt it is examined by a universal council. |
| 176 | Unde in quarta actione octavi universalis concilii, quando vicarii apostolicae sedis resistebant, ne semel iudicata per Nicolaum papam in synodo iterum refricarentur, obtinuerunt principes et senatores, qui dixerunt se nolle gestis ut testes subscribere, nisi admitterentur iudicati in synodo ad replicandum contra huiusmodi iudicata. | Whence in the fourth act of the eighth universal council, when the vicars of the apostolic see resisted, lest matters once judged by Pope Nicholas in the synod be again agitated, the princes and senators obtained [this], who said that they did not wish to subscribe as witnesses to the acts unless those judged in the synod were admitted to reply against such judgments. |
| 176 | Et surrexit Metrophanes, metropolita Smyrnae, dixit: «Probantes verba magnificentissimorum principum invenimus ea iusta et congruentia. | And Metrophanes, metropolitan of Smyrna, arose and said: "Having examined the words of the most magnificent princes, we find them just and fitting." |
| 176 | Huic favemus omnes episcopi et sancta haec synodus. | All the bishops and this holy synod favor this. |
| 176 | » Ecce, quod ex decreto synodi universalis fuit iudicium Nicolai papae et sui concilii de Photio iterum in universali concilio resistentibus etiam vicariis senioris Romae examinatum et depuratum. | Behold, the judgment of Pope Nicholas and his council concerning Photius, even with the vicars of senior Rome resisting, was examined and purified again in a universal council, according to the decree of the universal synod. |
| 177 | Ex quo apparet maioritas concilii universalis super papam et patriarchalem synodum. | From which it appears that the majority of the universal council is superior to the pope and the patriarchal synod. |
| 177 | Sic Leo papa ad omnes episcopos per universas provincias constitutos de omnium praedecessorum suorum epistulis dicit: «Omnia decretalia constituta tam a beatae memoriae Innocentio quam aliorum omnium praedecessorum, quae de ecclesiasticis ordinibus et canonum promulgata sunt disciplinis, ita vestram dilectionem custodire debere mandamus, ut, si quis in illa commiserit, veniam sibi deinceps noverit denegari», 19 di. | Thus Pope Leo says to all the bishops constituted throughout all the provinces concerning the letters of all his predecessors: "We command your love to observe all decretals established both by blessed memory Innocent and all other predecessors, which have been promulgated concerning ecclesiastical orders and the disciplines of canons, so that, if anyone shall have committed [a fault] in them, he shall know that pardon will be denied him thereafter," 19 di. |
| 177 | Si Romanorum. | If of the Romans. |
| 177 | Similiter loquitur Damasus papa, et habetur 25 q. | Pope Damasus speaks similarly, and it is found 25 q. |
| 177 | 1 Omnium. | 1 Omnium. |
| 177 | Et Hincmarus contra Laudunensem hanc epistulam pertractans dicit advertendum, quoniam promulgare est vulgo promere. | And Hincmar, discussing this letter against Laudunensis, says that it should be noted that to promulgate is to bring forth publicly. |
| 177 | Et non dicunt illi pontifices de simplici legum vel canonum promulgatione, sed de decretalibus de canonum disciplinis promulgatis. | And those pontiffs do not speak of the simple promulgation of laws or canons, but of decretals promulgated concerning the disciplines of canons. |
| 177 | Unde quando obviant canonibus, potius canonibus est oboediendum, 19 di. | Whence when they conflict with canons, it is rather to be obeyed to the canons, 19 di. |
| 177 | Ita Dominus § Hoc autem iuncta glossa et c. | Thus the Lord § This however joined gloss and c. |
| 177 | Secundum § Quia ergo, ubi probatur maioris esse auctoritatis veterum canones quam Romanorum pontificum decretales obviantes eis, licet moderni Gratianum ibi reprehendant. | According to § Because therefore, where it is proved that the canons of the ancients are of greater authority than the decretals of the Roman pontiffs conflicting with them, although the moderns there reprehend Gratian. |
| 178 | Et confirmatur: Manifestum est decretum synodi, cui interest per legatos auctoritas Romani pontificis, maioris aut saltem aequalis esse auctoritatis cum decretalibus papae. | And it is confirmed: It is manifest that the decree of the synod, in which the authority of the Roman pontiff is present through legates, is of greater or at least equal authority with the decretals of the pope. |
| 178 | Sed sic est quod talia concilia possunt provincialia dici, 3 di. | But it is so that such councils can be called provincial, 3 di. |
| 178 | § Porro, et alio vocabulo localia, 1 q. | § Furthermore, and in another word local, 1 q. |
| 178 | 7 Convenientibus. | 7 Convenientibus. |
| 178 | Provincialia autem per universalia corrigi posse dubium non est, ut superius est ostensum, et textus est 2 q. | But that provincial [councils] can be corrected by universal [councils] is not in doubt, as has been shown above, and the text is 2 q. |
| 178 | 7 Puto § Item: Cum Petrus, id est, ubi dicit sanctus Augustinus praeferendum esse statutum universalis concilii auctoritati unius episcopi vel provincialis concilii. | 7 Puto § Item: Cum Petrus, that is, where Saint Augustine says that the statute of a universal council is to be preferred to the authority of a single bishop or a provincial council. |
| 178 | Et facit optime ille textus ad propositum, ut patet ex eius assumpto: si Paulus corripuit Petrum, igitur a fortiori universalis concilii auctoritas etc. | And that text serves the purpose excellently, as is evident from its assumption: if Paul rebuked Peter, therefore a fortiori the authority of a universal council etc. |
| 178 | Item Innocentius scribit de canonibus Nicaenis et Sardicensibus, et Bonifatius ad Rusticum Narbonensem, qui dicit sanctos patres in Nicaea spiritu sancto suggerente, et aliter credendum non est, sibimet canones statuerunt, et addit: «Ut advertat caritas tua adeo nos praecepta canonum servare, ut similiter constitutio nostra diffiniat. | Likewise Innocent writes of the Nicene and Sardican canons, and Boniface to Rusticus of Narbonne, who says that the holy fathers in Nicaea, the Holy Spirit suggesting, and it is not to be believed otherwise, established canons for themselves, and he adds: "That your charity should note that we observe the precepts of the canons so that similarly our constitution defines." |
| 179 | Hoc etiam in epistula Caelestini ad universos episcopos per Calabriam constitutos. | This also in the letter of Celestine to all the bishops constituted throughout Calabria. |
| 179 | Et Leo papa ad Anatholium &laddConstantinopolitanum&radd dicit: «Nicaenos canones usque in finem mundi mansuros per sanctos patres conditos, qui apud nos in suis constitutionibus vivunt, et si quid per aliquem aliter statuendo praesumitur, sine cunctatione cassatur», et ad eundem: «Illa, inquit, Nicaenorum canonum per sanctum spiritum ordinata conditio nulla est usquam ex parte solubilis, cum tanto divinitus privilegio sit sancta synodus consecrata, ut, sive per pauciores sive per plures ecclesiastica iudicia celebrentur, omni penitus auctoritate sit vacuum, quidquid ab illorum fuerit constitutione diversum. | And Pope Leo to Anatolius of Constantinople says: "The Nicene canons, established by the holy fathers, are to remain to the end of the world, which live with us in their constitutions, and if anything is presumed otherwise by anyone, it is annulled without hesitation," and to the same: "That, he says, ordained condition of the Nicene canons through the Holy Spirit is nowhere dissoluble in any part, since the holy synod was consecrated with so great a divine privilege that, whether celebrated by fewer or by more churches, whatever is different from their constitution is entirely void of all authority." |
| 179 | » Idem ad Maximum Antiochenum: «Quidquid propter speciales causas synodalium ad examen episcopale affertur, potest, aliquam diiudicandi habere rationem, si nihil de eo est a sanctis patribus apud Nicaeam diffinitum. | The same to Maximus of Antioch: "Whatever is brought to episcopal examination for special causes of synods can have some reason for judgment, if nothing about it has been defined by the holy fathers at Nicaea." |
| 179 | Nam quod ab illorum constitutionibus et regulis discordat, apostolicae sedis numquam poterit habere consensum. | For that which disagrees with their constitutions and rules can never have the consent of the apostolic see. |
| 179 | » Et idem ad Anastasium: «A regulis praestatutis nulla aut negligentia aut praesumptione est decedendum. | And the same to Anastasius: "From the established rules there is to be no departure either through negligence or presumption." |
| 179 | » Et Gelasius in generali decreto ad omnes episcopos: «Cum nobis contra salutarium reverentiam regularum cupiamus nihil licere», De consecratione di. | And Gelasius in a general decree to all bishops: "Since we wish nothing to be permitted to us against the reverence of salutary rules," De consecratione di. |
| 179 | 1 Basilicas, ubi textus coniuncta glossa habet, quod, cum Romana ecclesia sit suprema et pio devotoque proposito studeat servare canones et etiam propter utilitatem fortasse alicuius non relaxet, ideo totum corpus ecclesiae canones servare debet. | 1 Basilicas, where the text with the joined gloss has that, since the Roman church is supreme and strives with pious and devout purpose to observe the canons and also perhaps for the utility of someone does not relax [them], therefore the whole body of the church ought to observe the canons. |
| 179 | Item Hormisda ad Remigium, sanctum Remensem archiepiscopum: «Paternas regulas, decreta sanctissimis diffinitiva conciliis ab omnibus servanda mandamus; hiis, quantum dignum est, reverentia custoditis. | Likewise Hormisda to Remigius, the holy archbishop of Reims: "We command that paternal rules, decrees definitively established by the most holy councils, be observed by all; these you guard with reverence as much as is fitting." |
| 179 | Nullum relinquit culpae locum sanctae observationis obstaculum. | No place for fault leaves the obstacle of holy observance. |
| 179 | Ibi fas nefasque praescriptum est. | There right and wrong are prescribed. |
| 179 | Ibi prohibitum, ad quod nullus audeat aspirare. | There is prohibited that to which no one dares aspire. |
| 180 | Ex quibus satis lucide patet opinionem antiquorum non fuisse papam per universalia concilia ligari non posse, sed potius, quod ipse inter omnes tamquam caput regulis traditis per universale concilium usus semper fuit ac etiam uti oportere confessi sunt. | From which it is clear that the opinion of the ancients was that the pope could not be bound by the universal councils, but rather that he himself, as the head, always used the rules laid down by the universal council and even confessed that he ought to do so. |
| 180 | Et dicit Fabianus papa, 11 q. | And Pope Fabian, 11th. |
| 180 | 3: «Qui omnipotentem deum metuit, nec contra evangelium Christi nec contra apostolos nec contra prophetas vel sanctorum patrum instituta agere aliquid nullo modo consentit. | "He who fears the omnipotent God does not consent to do anything against the Gospel of Christ, nor against the apostles, nor against the prophets, nor against the institutions of the holy fathers in any way." |
| 180 | » Ecce, quod Romani pontifices deum timentes agere non consentiunt contra sanctorum patrum instituta. | "Behold, the Roman pontiffs, fearing God, do not consent to do anything against the institutions of the holy fathers." |
| 181 | Et adhuc alio argumento idem probatur. | And the same is proven by another argument. |
| 181 | Manifestum est Leonem papam in certis capitulis constitutiones Calcedonensis concilii, praesertim quod Constantinopolitana praecedere deberet Alexandrinam, non recepisse, sed semper reclamasse, et post eum aliqui, et tamen decretum concilii semper obtinuit, ut patet De privilegiis Antiqua et 22 di. | It is clear that Pope Leo did not accept, but rather always protested, certain chapters of the Council of Chalcedon, especially since Constantinople should have precedence over Alexandria, as is evident from the privileges of the Antiqua and 22nd days. |
| 181 | Renovantes et in sessionibus et subscriptionibus conciliorum post Calcedonense. | Renewing the sessions and subscriptions of the councils after Chalcedon. |
| 181 | Si autem papa in sua potestate haberet posse decreta universalium conciliorum tollere, obtinuisset Leo et aliqui sui successores. | If, however, the pope had the power to abolish the decrees of the universal councils, Leo and some of his successors would have obtained it. |
| 181 | Quod verum non est iuxta praemissa. | Which is not true according to the preceding. |
| 181 | Hoc etiam est advertendum, quod, licet tribus capitulis Leo papa de capitulis Calcedonensis concilii se opposuisset, ut Hincmarus late prosequitur in libro praeallegato, tamen non restitit tamquam ex sua auctoritate, sed ex auctoritate concilii Nicaeni, cuius canones inviolabiles esse voluit, et eorum custodiam ad se dixit pertinere, quibus illa capitula contrariari dixit. | We must also note that, although Pope Leo opposed three chapters of the Council of Chalcedon, as Hincmar follows in the aforementioned book, he did not resist as from his own authority, but from the authority of the Council of Nicaea, whose canons he wanted to be inviolable and whose guardianship he said pertained to him, by which he said the aforementioned chapters were contrary. |
| 181 | Sic similiter Africanum concilium restitit Caelestino in eo, quod contra canonem Nicaeni concilii venire voluit. | Similarly, the African Council resisted Caelestine in that it wanted to go against the canon of the Council of Nicaea. |
| 181 | Et Caelestinus non dixit se hoc posse, sed allegabat idem concilium pro se et corrupte, quia non bene habuit translatum, ut patet in epistula concilii Africani ad papam Caelestinum, urbis Romae episcopum, quae incipit: &laddDomino dilectissimo&radd. | And Caelestine did not say that he could do this, but alleged the same council for himself and corrupted it, because it was not well translated, as is evident in the letter of the African Council to Pope Caelestine, bishop of Rome, which begins: "To the most beloved lord". |
| 181 | Revertendo tamen ad Leonem tunc etiam, quia una est auctoritas omnium universalium conciliorum, 16 di. | Returning, however, to Leo at that time, because there is one authority of all the universal councils, 16th. |
| 181 | Sancta, non etiam pro ea parte obtinuit quoad ordinem sedium patriarchalium, ut ex superioribus est manifestum. | The holy, not even in that part obtained the order of the patriarchal sees, as is evident from what has been said above. |
| 182 | Deinde, ut propius exemplum huius adducamus, concilium Basiliense universale decrevit in secunda sessione Romanum pontificem contra c. | Then, in order to bring up an example of this, the Council of Basil, the universal, decreed in the second session that the Roman pontiff should be against c. |
| 182 | Frequens concilii Constantiensis non posse etiam quoad loci mutationem, licet in eodem c. | The frequent Council of Constantinople cannot also be against the Roman pontiff in terms of place, although it is in the same c. |
| 182 | Frequens nullum irritans decretum contra Romanum pontificem sit positum. | No decree of the Council of Constantinople is placed against the Roman pontiff. |
| 182 | Unde bene est ad hoc advertendum, quoniam sine dubio ex inspiratione spiritus sancti ita actum est, et hoc ex stabilitate concilii deprehendi potest. | From which it is well to be noted, since it is undoubtedly done by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and this can be seen from the stability of the council. |
| 182 | Arguit enim sanctus Augustinus in libro De trinitate contra Felicem ex instabilitate actitatorum contra Ariminense concilium. | For Saint Augustine argues in the book On the Trinity against Felix from the instability of those who acted against the Council of Ariminum. |
| 183 | Videmus nunc mirabili modo actum quod concilium Basiliense est fortiter dei gratia firmatum, licet in principio multis dubiosis fluctuationibus quassaretur, et hoc solum a deo est, qui est veritas permanens. | We see now in a wonderful way that the Council of Basil was firmly established by the grace of God, although it was shaken at the beginning by many dubious fluctuations, and this is only from God, who is the permanent truth. |
| 183 | Ergo omnia acta a principio per inspirationem spiritus sancti firmiter credamus. | Therefore, we should firmly believe in all the acts from the beginning by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. |
| 183 | Mirum satis, cur in prima sessione posito fundamento in c. | It is a remarkable thing, why in the first session, placed on the foundation in c. |
| 183 | Frequens concilii Constantiensis ad tria se convertit, scilicet exstirpationem haeresum, reformationem morum universae ecclesiae et pacem christicolarum. | The Council of Constantinople turned to three things, namely the eradication of heresies, the reformation of the morals of the universal church, and the peace of the Christians. |
| 183 | Inspirabat haec indubie sanctus spiritus, ne, cum papa forte resistere vellet, quaevis dubitatio universalitatis concilii oriri posset. | The Holy Spirit undoubtedly inspired this, lest, when the pope might resist, any doubt of the universality of the council could arise. |
| 183 | In hiis tribus iam diffinitio praecessit in Constantiensi concilio amplius indisputabilis et immutabilis. | In these three things the definition preceded in the Council of Constantinople more indisputable and immutable. |
| 183 | Ad hoc itaque firmum ante etiam adventum adversitatis se contulerat non absque divino instinctu concilium. | Therefore, the council had already placed itself on a firm foundation before the advent of adversity, not without divine instinct. |
| 183 | Subsecuta est praetensa translatio aut verius dissolutio concilii per papam. | The subsequent translation or rather dissolution of the council by the pope followed. |
| 183 | Postquam sequitur secunda sessio concilii, quae in mirabili syllogismo concludit sic arguendo: Papa omnibus reformatoriis decretis oboedire tenetur; capitulum Frequens est huiusmodi, igitur oboedire tenetur. | After which follows the second session of the council, which concludes in a wonderful syllogism arguing thus: The pope must obey all reforming decrees; The decree of the Council of Constantinople is of this kind, therefore he must obey it. |
| 183 | Maior est decretum concilii Constantiensis et minor probatur per textum decreti Frequens; tunc ultra oboedire tenetur. | The decree of the Council of Constantinople is greater and is proven by the text of the decree Frequens; therefore he must obey it. |
| 183 | Ergo subest; igitur tollere aut mutare non potest. | Therefore, it is not possible to abolish or change it. |
| 184 | Si hunc syllogismum spiritus sanctus indubie dictavit in hoc sacro concilio, quid opus est amplius dubitare aut disputare, an ita papa per decreta reformatoria ligari possit, quod in contrarium venire non possit? | If this syllogism was undoubtedly dictated by the Holy Spirit in this sacred council, what need is there to doubt or dispute whether the pope can be bound by the decrees of reform, that he cannot go against them? |
| 184 | Item si Constantiense concilium dicit papam non oboedientem puniri posse, tunc vigor essendi concilium non dependet totaliter a papa, quia, dum nollet esse concilium: si tunc non esset, quomodo umquam puniretur, qui per solum concilium puniri potest? | Similarly, if the Council of Constantinople says that the pope cannot be punished for not obeying, then the power of the council does not depend entirely on the pope, because, if he did not want to be a council, how could he ever be punished, since he can only be punished by the council? |
| 184 | Item decretum Constantiensis et Senensis conciliorum dicit patres Basileae congregatos hoc tempore vere facere concilium. | Similarly, the decrees of the Councils of Constantinople and Siena say that the fathers gathered at Basil were truly making a council at this time. |
| 184 | Papa dicit, quia ipse non vult, non esse. | The pope says, because he does not want it, it is not. |
| 184 | Quis est adeo insanus, qui diceret falsam esse conciliorum sententiam, in qua necessario includebatur auctoritas Romani pontificis, et veram esse voluntatem papae Eugenii? | Who is so mad as to say that the judgment of the councils is false, in which the authority of the Roman pontiff was necessarily included, and that the will of Pope Eugene is true? |
| 184 | Si spiritus sanctus dixit se Basileae hoc tempore in universali concilio velle inspirare, dum ederentur decreta praetactorum conciliorum, quomodo potest papa Eugenius dicere hoc verum esse, si ipse velit, et non alias? | If the Holy Spirit said that it wanted to inspire at Basil in a universal council, when the decrees of the prelates of the councils were being made, how can Pope Eugene say that this is true, if he wants it, and not otherwise? |
| 184 | Ac si inspiratio foret ipsius sancti spiritus in potestate Romani pontificis, quod tunc, quando ipse velit, inspiret. | And if the inspiration were in the power of the Roman pontiff, then, when he wants, he would inspire. |
| 184 | Si enim ad memoriam reducis, quomodo sancti patres in suis constitutionibus vivunt, et quomodo, sicut una est ecclesia aliis morientibus et aliis in locum succedentibus, quod sic etiam universalia concilia sibi succedunt, tunc praefata facile intelligis. | For, if you recall, how the holy fathers lived in their constitutions, and how, as there is one church, with others dying and others succeeding, so also the universal councils succeed each other, then you easily understand the aforesaid. |
| 185 | Non tamen negari debet, quin Romanus pontifex epikeia uti possit. | However, it must not be denied that the Roman pontiff can have equity. |
| 185 | Legitur enim in prima actione octavi concilii Adrianum scripsisse sic: «Ut cum Gelasio papa dicamus, necessaria rerum dispositione constringimur et apostolicae sedis moderamine convenimur, sic canonum paternorum decreta librare et retro praesulum decessorumque nostrorum praecepta metiri, ut, quae praesentium necessitas temporum restaurandis ecclesiis relaxanda deposcit, adhibita consideratione diligenti, quantum potest fieri, temperemus: quod et nos aequa possumus pro lucrandis fratribus ratione prosequi et temporum necessitati consulendo penitus imitari. | For it is read in the first action of the eighth council that Adrian wrote thus: "As we say with Pope Gelasius, we are constrained by the necessary disposition of things and convened by the moderation of the apostolic see, so we must weigh the decrees of the holy fathers and measure the precepts of our predecessors, the bishops, in order to temper, with diligent consideration, as much as can be done, what the present necessity of the times requires to be restored and relaxed, so that we can follow the reason of our brothers for the benefit of the churches and imitate the counsel of the times in a deep way." |
| 185 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 185 | Et habetur 1 q. | And it is held in 1 q. |
| 185 | 7 Necessaria et ibi in § Nisi rigor. | 7 Necessary and there in § Nisi rigor. |
| 186 | Ecce, hoc fatendum est eo modo quo scribitur, ut haec in necessitate et utilitate pro restaurandis ecclesiis adhibita consideratione diligenti, quantum fieri potest, temperentur. | Behold, this must be acknowledged in the manner in which it is written, so that these things, having been considered with diligent attention for the sake of necessity and utility in restoring churches, may be tempered as much as possible. |
| 186 | Et pro hoc est notandus § Sed sciendum cum glossa 61 di. | And for this reason, it is to be noted, as stated in the gloss of 61, di. |
| 186 | et 1 q. | and 1 q. |
| 186 | 1 Quod propter necessitatem in glossa, quia, cum ecclesiasticae prohibitiones habeant certas causas, tunc illis cessantibus, licet ius ob suam generalitatem non cesset, habet tamen relaxatio locum. | For in the gloss, it is said that because of necessity, since ecclesiastical prohibitions have certain causes, when these causes cease, although the law itself, due to its generality, does not cease, relaxation nonetheless has a place. |
| 186 | Venire enim contra generalem prohibitionem in particulari casu, ubi necessitas vel utilitas hoc suadet, quoniam iuris causa cessat, talis relaxatio non proprie est iuris relaxatio, sed declaratio, casum illum in ratione legis non comprehendi, 28 di. | For to come against a general prohibition in a particular case, where necessity or utility advises it, since the cause of the law ceases, such relaxation is not properly a relaxation of the law, but a declaration that the case is not comprehended by the law, as in 28, di. |
| 186 | De Syracusanae. | Concerning the Syracusan. |
| 186 | Verum quia causae illius declarationis vel interpretationis, dispensationis aut relaxationis debent vere concludere ad hoc, quod relaxatio, declaratio vel temperatio locum habeat, ideo sacrum concilium Basiliense, quia causas in bulla dissolutionis aut translationis Eugenii papae positas non invenit veraciter concludentes, declaravit huiusmodi dispositionem contra c. | But because the causes of that declaration or interpretation, dispensation, or relaxation must truly conclude that relaxation, declaration, or tempering has a place, therefore the sacred Council of Basel declared that such a disposition is against the canons, since the causes stated in the bull of dissolution or translation by Pope Eugene were not found to be truly conclusive. |
| 186 | Frequens concilii Constantiensis nullam ex inefficacia causarum in bulla allegatarum et per consequens eum non potuisse. | The frequent council of Constance, on the other hand, found that there was no inefficacy of the causes alleged in the bull, and consequently, that it could not be done. |
| 186 | Non dico tamen, etiamsi causae verae fuissent, ipsum solum tamquam sua auctoritate absque concilii consensu potuisse, sed si verae fuissent, potuisset, quia concilium consensisset. | I do not say, however, that even if the causes were true, the pope alone could have done it by his own authority without the consent of the council, but if the causes were true, he could have done it, because the council would have consented. |
| 186 | Et hoc probatur actione quarta octavi concilii universalis in epistula Nicolai papae ad Photium, ubi ad obiectionem Photii de Nectario in secunda synodo de laico in episcopum Constantinopolitanum promoto respondendo dicit necessitatem in causa dispensationis fuisse et subiungit, quod secunda synodus non confirmavit neque sanxit quod hoc iterum fieret, quia, quod contra patrum atque canonicas sanctiones pro necessitatis eventu fieri comprobatur, non in auctoritate tenendum est, et infra: «Ecce, propter necessitatem et inopiam clericorum Nectarius, propter ecclesiastica dogmata et haereticorum expugnationem, qui venerandas deponere imagines praesumpserunt, Tarasius et per miraculorum signa Ambrosius ad regendas ecclesias promoti sunt. | And this is proven by the fourth action of the eighth universal council in the letter of Pope Nicholas to Photius, where, in responding to Photius's objection about Nectarius, who was promoted to bishop of Constantinople in the second synod, he says that there was necessity in the cause of dispensation, and he adds that the second synod did not confirm or sanction that this should be done again, because what is done contrary to the sanctions of the fathers and the canons for the sake of necessity is not to be held as authoritative. |
| 186 | » Haec ille. | He says these things. |
| 187 | Ex quo habetur necessitatem, utilitatem aut miracula causas esse concludentes temperamentum iuris sive generalis canonis, 55 di. | From which it is understood that necessity, utility, or miracles are causes that conclude the tempering of the law or the general canon, as in 55, di, Priscis. |
| 187 | Priscis. | In ancient times. |
| 187 | Glossa tamen antiqua 1 q. | The ancient gloss, however, says in 1 q, 1, that it is said "because of necessity," as in the case of utility, as in 1 q, 1, Dahibertum, because of mercy, as in 1 q, 5, c, last, because of the custom of many, as in 4, di. |
| 187 | 1 Quod propter necessitatem dicit propter necessitatem, ut ibi, propter utilitatem, ut 1 q. | Finally, because of multitude, as in 23, q, 4, "It is not possible." |
| 187 | 1 Dahibertum, propter misericordiam, 1 q. | It is also contrary to common law that, against the Council of Nicaea, which prohibited the changing of sees and translations, dispensation has often been made due to necessity and utility, as in 7, q, 1, "Changes," and the following. |
| 187 | 5 c. | For with regard to necessity, there is no doubt, because necessity is not subject to human constitution, but rather excuses what is done against it, as in De consecratione, di, 1, "Just as," and di, 4, "Holy." |
| 187 | ultimo, propter consuetudinem multorum, 4 di. | But concerning utility, it must be acted upon moderately, so that canons are not relaxed for the sake of any utility, as Pope Gelasius says in De consecratione, di, 1, "Basilicas." |
| 187 | Denique, propter multitudinem, 23 q. | Hence Pope Nicholas says in 35, q, 9, that the Roman Church can do something dispensatorily, considering the ages, times, and grave necessities, just like Paul, but this must be observed when the Roman Church, with most careful consideration, has decided that it should be done, not when it wishes to retract what has been well defined. |
| 187 | 4 Non potest. | This text is to be noted, because, as the gloss says there, "it is possible to do good," as in 22, q, 2, "Let him do," and in this dispensation, it is to be noted, as stated in the gloss, § But it is to be known, 61, di, and the gloss on § These are all, ibidem. |
| 187 | Contra ius commune venitur etiam, quod contra concilium Nicaenum, quod prohibuit mutationes sedium et translationes, ex necessitate et utilitate saepe dispensatum sit, 7 q. | Hence it cannot be denied in any way that, due to necessity or evident utility, the pope can dispense against any statute, and indeed the Archdeacon says in c, Sanctorum, 70, di, that a bishop can do this, and he discusses this at length, saying, among other things, that if a canon were to prohibit this, it would be irrational, and he gives examples where bishops have dispensed against provincial and universal councils for these causes. |
| 187 | 1 Mutationes et c. | The pope, however, can dispense beyond this due to the prerogative of his person. |
| 187 | sequenti probatur. | Concerning this, he says, ibidem. |
| 187 | Quo enim ad necessitatem non habet dubium, quia necessitas non est subiecta humanae constitutioni, immo excusat, quod contra eam fit, De consecratione di. | And from these things, it is clear that the power of superintendence, which is for the utility of the Church in the pope, is not properly above the canons, but rather declares that the canons do not have a place in the occurring case due to rational causes. |
| 187 | 1 Sicut et di. | And thus dispensation is not properly a relaxation of the law in its true root, but a declaration, and it is only an apparent relaxation. |
| 187 | 4 Sanctum. | Therefore, if true causes do not exist that conclude that the occurring case is not included under the canon, it is not a true dispensation, but rather a dissipation, and indeed, he with whom dispensation has been made, because he is subject to the canon, cannot be absolved from its observation except for existing true and rational causes, according to the preceding, although the pope intended to exempt him through dispensation, he is nonetheless subject to the penalties and precepts of the Church, so that before God, he is bound by them, just like others, although the militant Church does not judge this, because it presumes that the pope has done it rightly and justly for true and rational causes. |
| 187 | De utilitate autem moderate adhuc agendum est, ut non propter cuiuscumque utilitatem relaxentur canones, ut dicit Gelasius papa De consecratione di. | And thus the gloss says in the word "to fulfill," c, Non est, De voto, and all the doctors, and for this and the above-mentioned things concerning the authority of the universal council, the text of Pope Pelagius from his register is to be noted, the tenor of which is as follows. |
| 187 | 1 Basilicas. | **Pelagius, pope, to Valerian, patrician**: If there is any doubt about the cause of the condemnation of the three chapters of the bishops of those parts, either let them elect learned men from among themselves or let each one come on his own and, receiving a suitable reason from us with the grace of God, return to the bosom of the common mother, the holy Catholic Church. |
| 187 | Unde Nicolaus papa 35 q. | For what your highness says, that we should convene and, as it were, hold a synod, the canons do not permit after a universal synod and after a judgment that, as it were, with one voice, nearly four thousand bishops, both metropolitan and singular, have pronounced in Constantinople, to recall the contention to the middle, nor is it permitted to congregate a particular synod. |
| 187 | 9 Sententiam dicit quod dispensatorie Romana ecclesia pro consideratione aetatum, temporum et gravium necessitatum ad instar Pauli aliquid agere potest, quod tamen observandum est, quando illa, scilicet Romana ecclesia, disertissima consideratione hoc fieri delegerit, non quando ipsa, quae bene sunt diffinita, retractare voluerit. | But whenever some doubt arises about a universal synod for some people, either those who desire the salvation of their souls come spontaneously to the apostolic see to receive a reason about what they do not understand, or, if perhaps, as has been said about such people, a sinner, when he has come to the depths of evils, despises, so that the obstinate and contumacious have existed, who do not wish to be taught, it is necessary to attract them to salvation in some way from the same apostolic seats, or, lest they be able to be the destruction of others, they can be oppressed by secular powers according to the canons. |
| 187 | Qui textus notandus est, quoniam, ut dicit glossa ibidem, posse est in bono, 22 q. | Given on the 12th kalends of May in the year 17 after the consulship of Basil, a man of clarissimus rank. |
| 187 | 2 Faciat, et in ista dispensatione est notandus § Sed sciendum 61 di. | Behold, the decretal of Pelagius is to be noted in this, that it says the definition of the universal council is final, and that the pope ought not to solve doubts for those who seek them in the things defined by the universal council and inform the doubters. |
| 187 | et glossa in § Hiis omnibus ibidem. | And this decretal does much for the above-mentioned things, where it has been said about the authority of councils, and for the recently said things, namely, that the pope's dispensation against universal canons is not except a certain doctrinal declaration. |
| 187 | Unde nullo modo negari potest, quin propter necessitatem aut evidentem utilitatem papa dispensare possit contra quodcumque statutum, immo Archidiaconus dicit in c. | And it is to be noted that the causes of that declaration or interpretation, dispensation, or relaxation must truly conclude that relaxation, declaration, or tempering has a place. |
| 187 | Sanctorum 70 di. | Hence it cannot be denied in any way that, due to necessity or evident utility, the pope can dispense against any statute. |
| 187 | episcopum hoc posse; de quo late per eum ibidem, qui inter alia dicit quod, si canon aliquis hoc prohiberet, irrationabilis foret, et ponit exempla, ubi episcopi contra concilia tam provincialia quam universalia ex illis causis dispensarunt. | The Archdeacon says in c, Sanctorum, 70, di, that a bishop can do this. |
| 187 | Papa autem ultra hoc propter praerogativam personae dispensare potest. | The pope, however, can dispense beyond this due to the prerogative of his person, concerning which he says, ibidem. |
| 187 | De quo per eum ibidem. | And from these things, it is clear that the power of superintendence, which is for the utility of the Church in the pope, is not properly above the canons. |
| 188 | &laddEt ex istis patet, quod potestas superintendentiae, quae est ad utilitatem ecclesiae in papa, non est proprie supra canones, sed ipsa declarat canones in occurenti casu propter rationabiles causas locum non habere. | And thus dispensation is not properly a relaxation of the law in its true root, but a declaration, and it is only an apparent relaxation. |
| 188 | Et sic dispensatio non est proprie iuris in vera sua radice relaxatio sed declaratio, et est apparens relaxatio tantum. | Therefore, if true causes do not exist that conclude that the occurring case is not included under the canon, it is not a true dispensation, but rather a dissipation. |
| 188 | Quare si causae verae non subsunt, quae concludant hunc occurrentem casum sub ratione canonis non includi, non est vera dispensatio sed potius dissipatio; immo adhuc ille cum quo dispensatum est, quia canoni subest, a cuius observatione non potuit nisi subsistentibus veris et rationabilibus causis absolvi, secundum praemissa, quamquam etiam papa eum intendebat eximere per dispensationem, poenis et praecepto eius ita subest, quod coram deo ipse sicut alii ligatur per eum, licet ecclesia militans hoc non iudicet, quia pro papa praesumit quod scilicet ipse rite et iuste ex veris et rationabilibus causis ipsam fecerit. | And thus the gloss says in the word "to fulfill," c, Non est, De voto, and all the doctors. |
| 188 | Et ita dicit glossa in verbo adimplere c. | And for this and the above-mentioned things concerning the authority of the universal council, the text of Pope Pelagius from his register is to be noted. |
| 188 | Non est De voto et doctores omnes, et pro hoc et superius positis de auctoritate universalis concilii textus Pelagii papae singularis ex eius registro notandus est, cuius tenor subscribitur: «Pelagius papa Valeriano patricio. | **Pelagius, pope, to Valerian, patrician**: If there is any doubt about the cause of the condemnation of the three chapters of the bishops of those parts. |
| 188 | Si quid de causa dampnationis trium capitulorum episcopi illarum partium dubitant, quomodo consuetudo vetus habuit, aut eligant de suis doctos viros aut unusquisque pro se veniat et rationem a nobis cum dei gratia competenter accipiens ad matris communis sanctae catholicae ecclesiae viscera revertatur. | For what your highness says, that we should convene and, as it were, hold a synod, the canons do not permit after a universal synod and after a judgment. |
| 188 | Nam quod celsitudo vestra dicit, ubi convenire debeamus et quasi synodum facere, istud canones nulli permittunt post universalem synodum et post iudicium, quod tamquam uno ore prope quattuor milia episcoporum tam in metropolitanis suis quam singulares Constantinopoli protulerunt, iterum contentionem ad medium revocare, sed nec licuit aliquando nec licebit particularem synodum congregari. | But whenever some doubt arises about a universal synod for some people, either those who desire the salvation of their souls come spontaneously to the apostolic see. |
| 188 | Sed quotiens aliqua de universali synodo aliquibus dubitatio nascitur, ad recipiendam de eo, quod non intelligunt, rationem, aut sponte hii, qui salutem animae suae desiderant, ad apostolicam sedem pro percipienda ratione conveniunt, aut si forte, sicut de talibus dictum est, peccator cum venerit in profundum malorum, contempnit, ita obstinati et contumaces exstiterint, ut doceri non velint, eos ab eisdem apostolicis sedibus attrahi ad salutem quoquo modo necesse est aut, ne aliorum perditio esse possint, secundum canones per saeculares opprimi potestates. | And this decretal does much for the above-mentioned things, where it has been said about the authority of councils. |
| 188 | Data 12 kal. | Given on the 12th kalends of May in the year 17 after the consulship of Basil, a man of clarissimus rank. |
| 188 | Maiarum anno 17 p<ost> c<onsulatum> Basilii v<iri> c<larissimi>. | In the year 17 after the consulship of Basil, a man of clarissimus rank. |
| 188 | » Ecce decretalem Pelagii notandam in eo, quod diffinitionem universalis concilii ultimam dicit, et quod papa non debet in diffinitis per universale concilium dubia petentibus exsolvere et informare dubitantes. | Behold, the decretal of Pelagius is to be noted in this. |
| 188 | Et haec decretalis multum facit ad superiora, ubi de auctoritate conciliorum dictum est, et ad proxime dicta, scilicet quod papae dispensatio contra canones universales non est nisi quaedam doctrinalis declaratio. | And this decretal does much for the above-mentioned things, where it has been said about the authority of councils, and for the recently said things. |
| 188 | &radd | And thus the gloss says in the word "to fulfill," c, Non est, De voto, and all the doctors, and for this and the above-mentioned things concerning the authority of the universal council. |
| 189 | Ut autem bona consideratione et diligenti amplius causarum examinatio fiat, deputandi sunt cardinales, legati provinciarum, modo praetacto per hoc sacrum concilium, quorum consilio et subscriptione examinentur causae, an ita fieri expediat. | In order that a more thorough and diligent examination of cases may take place, cardinals and legates of provinces, appointed by this sacred council in the manner previously mentioned, are to be designated, whose counsel and subscription shall be required for the examination of cases, to determine whether it is expedient for such examination to take place. |
| 189 | Solebant etiam aliquando Romani pontifices in sua professione aperte profiteri cardinalium consilio et consensu suum se peracturos officium, ut haec habentur in professione Bonifatii octavi. | Formerly, Roman pontiffs were accustomed to declare openly in their profession that they would discharge their office with the counsel and consent of cardinals, as is contained in the profession of Boniface VIII. |
| 189 | Unde pro horum omnium conclusione, scilicet quod Romanus pontifex regulariter salva epikeia modo iam dicto oboedire teneatur canonibus universalium conciliorum, notetur canon primus octavi universalis concilii, qui declarat universali ecclesiae canones tradi per universalia concilia; deinde quod universale concilium profitetur eorundem observantiam. | Therefore, to conclude all these matters, namely, that the Roman pontiff is regularly bound, saving epikeia, in the manner already stated, to obey the canons of universal councils, it should be noted that the first canon of the eighth universal council declares that the canons are transmitted to the universal Church through universal councils; and further, that the universal council professes to observe them. |
| 189 | Cui canoni ac aliis omnibus eiusdem concilii manifestum est tam legatos sedis apostolicae quam alios cunctos se subscripsisse, ut in fine eiusdem concilii clare habetur, ubi dicitur: «Nos haec apostolica et synodica documenta sine ulla evacuatione custodimus. | It is manifest that both the legates of the apostolic see and all others subscribed to this canon and to all others of the same council, as is clearly stated at the end of the same council, where it is said: "We will observe these apostolic and synodical documents without any diminution." |
| 189 | » Et post aliqua sanctissimi vicarii senioris Romae dixerunt: «Quoniam providentia dei in prosperum finem omnia ecclesiae devenerunt negotia, oportet nos et in scriptis manu propria haec roborare secundum synodicam consequentiam. | And after some things, the most holy vicar of the senior Rome said: "Since the providence of God has brought all the affairs of the Church to a prosperous end, it is necessary for us also to confirm these things in writing with our own hand, according to synodical sequence." |
| 189 | » Non est autem dubium de universali ecclesia papam fidelem esse et eum sua professione et subscriptione obligari. | There is no doubt that the pope is faithful to the universal Church and is bound by his profession and subscription. |
| 189 | Est autem textus talis: «Et primo dicit rubrum de custodiendis et conservandis omnino antea expositis et ecclesiae traditis canonibus. | The text is as follows: "And first, it says in red that the canons previously expounded and handed down to the Church are to be entirely preserved and conserved." |
| 189 | » Textus autem sic: «Per aequam et regiae divinae iustitiae viam inoffense incedere volentes veluti quasdam lampades semper lucentes et illuminantes gressus nostros, quae secundum deum sunt, sanctorum diffinitiones et sensus retinere debemus. | The text is as follows: "Wishing to proceed unimpeded along the path of equal and royal divine justice, we ought to retain the definitions and sense of the saints, which are in accordance with God, as certain lamps always shining and illuminating our steps." |
| 189 | Quapropter et has ut secunda eloquia secundum magnum et sapientissimum Dionysium aestimantes et arbitrantes etiam de eis cum divino David enixe canimus: Mandatum domini lucidum illuminans oculos, et lucerna pedibus meis lex tua et lumen semitis meis. | Therefore, esteeming and judging these things as a second eloquence, according to the great and very wise Dionysius, we also earnestly sing concerning them with the divine David: "The commandment of the Lord is clear, illuminating the eyes; and thy law is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths." |
| 189 | Et cum proverbiatore dicimus: Mandatum lucerna est et lex lux. | And with the proverb, we say: "The commandment is a lamp and the law is light." |
| 189 | Et cum magnifico Isaia clamamus ad omnium deum: Quia lux praecepta tua super terram. | And with the magnificent Isaiah, we cry out to the God of all: "For thy precepts shine upon the earth." |
| 189 | Luci enim veraciter assimilatae sunt divinorum canonum hortationes et dissuasiones, secundum quod discernitur melius a peiori et expediens atque proficuum ab eo, quod non expedire, sed obesse dignoscitur. | For the exhortations and dissuasions of the divine canons are truly likened to light, according to which what is better is distinguished from what is worse, and what is expedient and profitable from what is not expedient but hurtful. |
| 189 | Igitur regulas, quae sanctae catholicae atque apostolicae ecclesiae tam a sanctis famosissimis apostolis quam ab orthodoxorum universalibus conciliis servare atque custodire profitemur, hiis et propriam vitam et morem regentes et omnem sacerdotii catalogum atque omnes, qui Christiano censentur vocabulo, poenis et dampnationibus et e diverso receptionibus et iustificationibus, quae per illas prolatae sunt atque diffinitae, subici canonice decernentes. | Therefore, we decree by canon that the rules which we profess to observe and preserve for the holy Catholic and apostolic Church, both by the holy and most famous apostles and by the universal councils of orthodox men, shall govern our own life and custom, and that all the catalog of priesthood and all who are reckoned under the Christian name shall be subject to the penalties and damnations, and on the other hand, to the receptions and justifications which have been pronounced and defined by them. |
| 189 | Tenere quippe traditiones, quas accepimus sive per sermonem sive per epistulam sanctorum, qui antea fulserunt, Paulus admonet aperte, magnus apostolus. | The great apostle Paul admonishes that we hold fast to the traditions which we have received either by word or by epistle from the saints who shone before. |
| 189 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 190 | Ecce nunc clarissimam decisionem papam regulariter ligari regulis universalium conciliorum. | Behold, now, the very clear decision that the pope is regularly bound by the rules of universal councils. |
| 190 | Igitur et inhibitio per universale concilium cum irritatione et sub poena gravissima sibi fieri potest, ut illis utatur nisi in casu epikeiae praeexpresso. | Therefore, inhibition can be made by a universal council with irritation and under the gravest penalty for one to use it unless in the case of epikeia previously expressed. |
| 190 | Hodie autem, quia universalis ecclesia, heu, ad solum patriarchatum Romanum redacta est, et quod quondam generale patriarchale tantum et subiectum Romano pontifici fuit, hodie est universale universam fidelium ecclesiam repraesentans, hinc cum hoc novum sit, dubitatio exorta est. | But today, because the universal Church, alas, has been reduced to the sole patriarchate of Rome, and what was once a general patriarchate subject only to the Roman pontiff, today represents the universal Church of all the faithful, hence a new situation has arisen, and doubt has been raised. |
| 190 | Quare hoc sacrum concilium absque passione cum summa mansuetudine se habere debet in ordine ad Romanum pontificem: non se ex privilegio universalis concilii in tantum erigat, de quo potius, [prohdolor] dolendum esset quod obliviscatur subiectionem patriarchalem, in qua semper fuit, secundum quam in papam fidelem nihil posset, sed servato debito honore cuncta pacifice in augmentum fidei et divini cultus et universale bonum catholicae ecclesiae unanimi concordantia ordinentur, ut videantur opera nostra bona et glorificetur deus qui in caelis est. | Wherefore, this sacred council ought to behave towards the Roman pontiff without passion and with the greatest mildness: it should not exalt itself by the privilege of a universal council to such an extent that it would be a matter for sorrow if it were to forget the patriarchal subjection in which it has always been, according to which it can do nothing against a faithful pope; but, saving due honor, all things should be ordained peacefully for the increase of faith and divine worship and the universal good of the Catholic Church in unanimous concordance, that our works may be seen to be good and God who is in heaven be glorified. |
| 191 | Capitulum XXI. | Chapter XXI. |
| 191 | Ad superiora unum adiciendum esse censeo, scilicet quod per istud sacrum concilium lex fieri aut verius ius antiquum posset innovari papam in arduis negotiis maxime contra canones huius et aliorum universalium conciliorum causis urgentibus absque dominorum cardinalium, qui clerici censentur universalis ecclesiae modo supradicto deputati, non posse quidquam; alias si fecerit, quod tunc illud irritum sit. | I think that one thing should be added to what has gone before, namely, that by this sacred council a law can be made or, rather, an ancient right can be innovated, that the pope in grave matters, especially against the canons of this and other universal councils, cannot do anything without the urgent cases and the counsel of the cardinals who have been appointed in the manner aforesaid as clerics of the universal Church; otherwise, if he does so, it shall be null and void. |
| 191 | Et iam praecessit Archidiaconi sententia et Ioannis Monachi et aliorum super hoc. | And already the sentence of the archdeacon and of John the Monk and of others has preceded on this matter. |
| 191 | Et est ultima resolutio, quod in tangentibus universalem ecclesiam verum est papam sine cardinalibus nihil posse. | And it is the final resolution that in matters touching the universal Church, it is true that the pope can do nothing without the cardinals. |
| 191 | Ego autem credo, quod contra canones venire et dispensare, etiam in quocumque particulari casu, rationabiliter dici posset hoc concernere universalem ecclesiam propter canonem universalis ecclesiae, qui laedi per huiusmodi dispensationem videtur. | But I believe that to contravene the canons and dispense, even in any particular case, can be reasonably said to concern the universal Church on account of the canon of the universal Church, which seems to be injured by such dispensation. |
| 191 | Unde quia argumentum a simili in iure forte est, 3 q. | Whence, because argument from similarity is strong in law, 3 q. 5. |
| 191 | 5 Quia suspecti, 20 di. | "Quia suspecti," 20 di. |
| 191 | In quibus, 10 di. | In which, 10 di. |
| 191 | Si in adiutorium, hinc adduco tale argumentum a simili. | If in aid, I adduce such an argument from similarity. |
| 191 | Episcopus habet de iure totam dispositionem dioecesis cum ecclesiis et dotibus et decimis, 10 q. | A bishop has by right the entire disposition of his diocese with its churches and endowments and tithes, 10 q. 1 Decretum; and yet he has not the power to alienate, give away, or exchange any of those things which are in his power without the consent and subscription of his clerics, 12 q. 2 Sine exceptione. |
| 191 | 1 Decretum, et tamen omnium illorum, quae ita in sua potestate consistunt, alienationem sive donationem sive permutationem absque consensu et subscriptione suorum clericorum non habet, 12 q. | And 32 c. of the African council says: "The donation, sale, or exchange of ecclesiastical property made by a bishop without the acquiescence and subscription of his clerics shall be void." |
| 191 | 2 Sine exceptione. | Therefore, by similarity: even if the whole Church were subject to the papal disposition as to a unique monarch, nevertheless, he cannot change or alienate the property of the Church, among which I believe the sacred canons especially to be, without the consent and subscription of his clergy. |
| 191 | Et dicit 32 c. | For by the name of the clergy of the Roman Church, inasmuch as the Roman Church signifies a monarchy, cardinals come, as has been said in a certain place. |
| 191 | Africani concilii: «Irrita erit episcoporum donatio vel venditio vel commutatio rei ecclesiasticae absque conniventia et subscriptione clericorum. | Moreover, it is manifest that the alienation of ecclesiastical property can be made only for the sake of utility or necessity; and so precisely also the change or dispensation of canons against them. |
| 191 | » Igitur a simili: etiam si dispositioni papali tota ecclesia subiaceret tamquam monarchae unico, tamen res ecclesiae, inter quas maxime sacros canones esse credo, iuxta superiora mutare vel alienare non potest sine sui cleri consensu et subscriptione. | And the argument is sufficiently strong by similarity. |
| 191 | Nomine enim cleri Romanae ecclesiae, in quantum monarchiam significat Romana ecclesia, cardinales veniunt, ut superius quodam loco dicitur. | And in favor of this is c. "Non liceat" 12 q. 2, which text in alienation seems to assimilate the pope to other bishops. |
| 192 | Praeterea manifestum est non nisi ex utilitate vel necessitate alienationem rerum ecclesiasticarum fieri posse, ita praecise et canonum mutationem sive dispensationem contra eos, et est argumentum satis a simili. | Moreover, the same African synod, to which the holy Augustine subscribed, 15 q. 7 "Episcopus," says: "No bishop shall hear a cause without the presence of his clerics; otherwise, the sentence of the bishop shall be void." |
| 192 | Et pro hoc facit c. | And it is manifest that a bishop has the universal disposition of his entire diocese, although he cannot pronounce grave sentences or hear causes without the presence of his clerics. |
| 192 | Non liceat 12 q. | Therefore, it is clear: just so also the pope is bound to act by similarity in the affairs of the universal Church. |
| 192 | 2, qui textus in alienatione videtur papam aliis assimilare episcopis. | Moreover, changes or alienations by one presiding in ecclesiastical affairs cannot be made without the counsel of a council or of the whole presbytery, as 12 q. 2 "Placuit," where it says: "Without consulting the council or presbytery," and c. "Episcopus," where it says: "In the presence of the council of the Church." |
| 192 | Praeterea eadem Africana synodus, cui se sanctus subscripsit Augustinus, 15 q. | Therefore, the pope cannot alienate the property of the Church entirely without the council of the Church, which is the universal council; among which things, it is manifest that the sacred canons are primarily concerned. |
| 192 | 7 Episcopus, dicit: «Episcopus nullus causam audiat absque praesentia suorum clericorum, alioquin irrita erit sententia episcopi. | The bishop says: "Let no bishop hear a case without the presence of his clergy, otherwise the bishop's sentence will be invalid." |
| 192 | » Et manifestum est episcopum dispositionem universaliter habere totius dioecesis, licet graves sententias ferre absque praesentia clericorum suorum et audire non possit. | And it is clear that the bishop has the general disposition of the entire diocese, although he cannot pronounce grave sentences or hear cases without the presence of his clergy. |
| 192 | Patet igitur: sic et papa facere tenetur a simili in factis universalis ecclesiae. | Therefore, it is evident that the pope is likewise bound to act similarly in matters of the universal church. |
| 192 | Praeterea mutationes aut alienationes per praesidentem in ecclesiasticis praesidibus fieri non possunt absque consilio concilii sive totius presbyterii, ut 12 q. | Moreover, changes or alienations by the presiding bishop in ecclesiastical matters cannot be made without the counsel of the council or the entire presbytery, as in 12 q. |
| 192 | 2 Placuit, ubi dicit: «Inconsulto concilio vel presbyterio», et c. | 2 It was decided, where it says: "Without consulting the council or presbytery," and c. |
| 192 | Episcopus, ubi dicit: «Coram concilio ecclesiae». | The bishop, where it says: "Before the council of the church." |
| 192 | Igitur ita papa penitus alienare res ecclesiae sine concilio ecclesiae, quod est universale concilium, non potest; inter quas res principaliter sacros canones esse manifestum est. | Therefore, the pope cannot entirely alienate the property of the church without the council of the church, which is the universal council; among which things, the sacred canons are manifestly principal. |
| 193 | Unde licet cardinales possint in particularibus casibus contra canones propter necessitatem aut utilitatem consulere et subscriptione sua firmare dispensationem, hoc tamen absque canonum praeiudicio tantum credo possunt. | From this, it seems that cardinals may, in particular cases, consult and confirm with their signature a dispensation against the canons, due to necessity or utility, but only, I believe, without prejudice to the canons. |
| 193 | Tollere autem canones universalium conciliorum absque consensu universalis concilii credo papam cum cardinalibus non posse. | However, I believe that the pope, with the cardinals, cannot abolish the canons of universal councils without the consent of the universal council. |
| 193 | Et eo casu, quo cardinales consensum praebere habent, habet quilibet coniudicare casum, sed non quilibet ius iudicandi, quia ius non est nisi apud collegium et non apud quemlibet de collegio, secundum notam doctorum post Innocentium in c. | And in that case, where the cardinals have given their consent, each one has the right to judge the case, but not everyone has the right to judge, because the right is only with the college and not with any individual member of the college, according to the opinion of the doctors after Innocent in c. |

| 193 | Legitur enim in gestis contra Hildebrandum, qui Gregorius papa septimus vocabatur, sic: «Est autem privilegium Romanae sedis semper assistere per cardinales presbyteros et diaconos ipsi summo pontifici vel vicario ipsius sedis, id est ei, quem ipsa sedes sacrosancta os eius facit, per quem et cum quo praedicat, per quem sacramenta administrat, per quem et cum quo firmanda confirmat et improbanda improbat, qua non subscribente invalida est summi pontificis sententia. | For it is read in the acts against Hildebrand, who was called Pope Gregory VII, thus: "Moreover, it is the privilege of the Roman See always to be assisted by the cardinal priests and deacons, the same supreme pontiff or his vicar, that is, the one whom the Holy See makes his mouthpiece, through whom and with whom he preaches, through whom he administers the sacraments, through whom and with whom he confirms and rejects, and without whose signature the sentence of the supreme pontiff is invalid." |
| 193 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 193 | Ecce, quomodo ab antiquo irrita fuit Romani pontificis sententia absque cardinalium subscriptione, et quod papa sedis apostolicae os tantum fuit. | Behold, how from ancient times the sentence of the Roman pontiff was invalid without the signature of the cardinals, and that the pope of the Apostolic See was only a mouthpiece. |

| 194 | Provinciale concilium unius provinciae ex metropolitano et suffraganeis et aliis de provincia ad ordinandum res provinciae colligitur per archiepiscopum, sine quo plenum et perfectum non est, quia ipse curam et sollicitudinem gerit totius provinciae. | A provincial council of a single province is assembled by the archbishop from the metropolitan and suffragans and others of the province to regulate the affairs of the province, without whom it is not complete and perfect, because he bears the care and concern of the entire province. |

| 195 | Hoc autem concilium est valde necessarium magnam habens auctoritatem ex conciliis universalibus disponendi et ordinandi omnia ad provinciam necessaria praeter ea quae universalem ecclesiam respiciunt, quoniam maiorem auctoritatem illa requirunt. | This council is, however, very necessary, having great authority from the universal councils to dispose and order everything necessary for the province, except those things that concern the universal Church, since they require greater authority. |
| 195 | Quantum autem sit utile ecclesiae dei hoc concilium et alia, legitur in tertio c. | How useful this council and others are to the Church of God is read in the third c. |
| 195 | Toletani concilii, ubi dicitur: «Nulla paene res disciplinae mores ab ecclesia Christi magis depulit quam sacerdotum negligentia, qui contemptis canonibus ad corrigendos ecclesiasticos mores synodum facere negligunt. | Of the Council of Toledo, where it is said: "Almost no matter of discipline and morals has been more removed from the Church of Christ than the negligence of the priests, who, neglecting the canons, neglect to hold a synod to correct the ecclesiastical morals." |
| 195 | Ob hoc a nobis universaliter diffinitum est, ut, quia iuxta antiqua patrum decreta bis in anno difficultas temporis fieri concilium non sinit, saltem vel semel a nobis celebretur, ita tamen, ut, si fidei causa est aut quaelibet alia ecclesiae communis, generalis totius Hispaniae atque Galliae synodus convocetur. | For this reason, it has been universally defined by us that, because the difficulty of the time, according to the ancient decrees of the fathers, does not allow a council to be held twice a year, it should be celebrated at least once, but in such a way that if the cause is of faith or any other common good of the Church, a general synod of the whole of Spain and Gaul should be convened. |
| 195 | Si vero nec de fide nec de communi ecclesiae utilitate tractabitur, speciale fiat concilium, prout uniuscuiusque provinciae metropolitanus elegerit peragendum. | But if neither faith nor the common good of the Church is discussed, a special council should be held, as the metropolitan of each province shall have chosen to hold. |
| 195 | Omnes autem, qui causas contra episcopos aut iudices ac potentes aut contra quoslibet alios habere noscuntur, ad idem concilium concurrant, et, quaecumque examine synodali a quibuslibet prave usurpata inveniuntur, regii exsecutoris instantia vastissime hiis, quibus iura sunt, reformentur, ita ut pro compellendis iudicibus vel saecularibus viris ad synodum metropolitani studio quidem exsecutor a principe postuletur. | Moreover, all who are known to have causes against bishops or judges and powerful men or against any others should attend the same council, and whatever is found by synodal examination to have been unjustly usurped by anyone, with the insistence of the royal executor, should be fully restored to those to whom the rights belong, so that the judges or secular men may be compelled to attend the synod, the executor, at the request of the metropolitan, should be requested from the prince. |
| 195 | Quintadecima autem kalendarum Iuniarum congreganda est in unaquaque provincia synodus propter vernale tempus, quando herbis terra vestitur et pabula germinum inveniuntur. | Moreover, a synod should be convened in each province on the fifteenth of the kalends of June, because of the spring time, when the earth is clothed with herbs and the fodder of the young plants is found. |
| 195 | » Haec ibi. | This is there. |
| 195 | Ecce, quod istud decretum fuit in quodam universali concilio totius Hispaniae et Galliae editum, et disponit de provinciis illi concilio subiectis ac etiam dicit, quod, quae fidem et generalem ecclesiam respiciunt, in tali universali concilio tractari debere. | Behold, that this decree was issued in a certain universal council of all Spain and Gaul, and it provides for the provinces subject to that council, and also states that matters concerning faith and the general Church should be discussed in such a universal council. |
| 195 | Ex quo est menti tenendum quod universalis multarum provinciarum synodus &laddest&radd supra ipsas provincias generales quae fidei etiam causas tractare possit. | From which it is to be understood that a universal synod of many provinces can and should deal with general matters that concern the faith. |
| 195 | Et haec ob subsequentia sunt notanda. | And these things are to be noted for the following reasons. |
| 196 | Fuit in alio concilio praecedenti etiam universali tali Toletano diffinitum in autumno in kalendis Novembr<ibus> concilium provinciale celebrari debere, et quod iudices locorum et auctores fiscalium patrimoniorum ex decreto regis concurrere deberent, ut discerent, quam pie et iuste cum populis agere debeant, ne in angariis aut operibus superfluis sive privatum <onerent> sive fiscalem gravent, et quod hoc tunc episcopi perspicere deberent, quomodo iudices cum populo agerent, et eos, si excesserint, corrigerent aut regi denuntiarent. | It was also defined in another preceding universal council, such as the Toledo council, that a provincial council should be held in the autumn on the kalends of November, and that the judges of the places and the authors of the fiscal patrimonies should attend by decree of the king, so that they might learn how to act piously and justly with the people, so that they might not burden either the private or the fiscal with unnecessary tasks or works, and that the bishops should then observe how the judges acted with the people, and correct them if they exceeded, or denounce them to the king. |
| 196 | Si se emendare nollent, a communione tunc eos suspendere possent, et quod etiam de poena iudicis non venientis ad synodum deliberare possent. | If they did not wish to amend themselves, they could then suspend them from communion, and that they could also deliberate on the penalty of the judge who did not come to the synod. |
| 196 | Et fuit adiectum: «Concilium autem non solvatur, nisi locum prius elegerint, quo succedenti tempore iterum ad concilium veniatur, ut iam non necesse habeat metropolitanus episcopus pro congregando concilio litteras destinare, si in priori concilio tempus omnibus denuntiatur et locus. | And it was added: "But the council shall not be dissolved until they have first chosen a place where they will come again to the council at a later time, so that the metropolitan bishop will no longer need to send letters to convene the council, if the time and place are announced to all in the prior council." |
| 197 | Capitulum XXIII. | Chapter XXIII. |
| 197 | Forma vero, quomodo celebrari debeat hoc concilium, diffinita in quarto capitulo concilii Toletani tempore Sisenandi regis anno Christi 581 celebrati sic describitur: «Hora itaque diei prima ante solis ortum eiciantur omnes ab ecclesia obseratisque foribus cunctis ad unam ianuam, per quam sacerdotes ingredi oportet, ostiarii sedeant, et convenientes omnes episcopi pariter introeant et secundum ordinationis suae tempora resideant. | The true form, how this council should be celebrated, was defined in the fourth chapter of the Council of Toledo during the reign of King Sisenand in the year 581, as follows: "At the first hour of the day before the sun rises, all should be driven out of the church and through the observed doors to one door, where the priests must enter, the doorkeepers should sit, and all the bishops should enter together and remain according to their order of rank. |
| 197 | Post ingressum omnium episcoporum atque consessum vocentur deinde presbyteri, quos causa probaverit introire. | After the entry of all the bishops and the assembly, the priests should then be called, and those who have been proven worthy to enter should be summoned. |
| 197 | Nullus se inter eos ingerat diaconorum. | No deacon should intrude among them. |
| 197 | Post hos ingrediantur diacones probabiles, quos ordo poposcerit interesse, et corona facta de sedibus episcoporum presbyteri a tergo eorum resideant, diacones in conspectu eorum stent. | Afterwards, the worthy deacons should enter, as the order requires them to be present, and the priests should sit behind them from their seats, and the deacons should stand before them. |
| 197 | Deinde ingrediantur laici, qui electioni concilii interesse meruerint, tum quoque et notarii, quos ad recitandum vel excipiendum ordo requirit, et obserentur ianuae. | Then the laity should enter, who have merited to be part of the council, as well as the notaries, as the order requires, and the doors should be closed. |
| 197 | Sedentesque in diuturno silentio sacerdotes et cor tantum habentes ad deum, dicat archidiaconus: Orate. | Sitting in prolonged silence, the priests and those with pure hearts towards God, the archdeacon should say: Pray. |
| 197 | Statimque omnes in terram prostrabuntur et orantes diutius taciti cum fletibus atque gemitibus, unus ex episcopis senioribus surgens orationem palam fundat ad dominum cunctis adhuc in terra iacentibus. | Immediately, all will fall to the ground and pray silently for a long time with tears and groans, and one of the older bishops will rise and publicly pray to the Lord while all are still lying on the ground. |
| 197 | Finita autem oratione et responso ab omnibus: Amen, rursus dicat diaconus: Erigite vos. | When the prayer is finished and all respond: Amen, the deacon should then say: Rise up. |
| 197 | Et confestim omnes surgant et cum omni timore dei et disciplina tam episcopi quam presbyteri sedeant. | And immediately all should rise and sit with all fear of God and discipline, both the bishops and the priests. |
| 197 | Sicque omnibus in suis locis in silentio consedentibus diaconus alba indutus codicem canonum in medio proferens capitula de conciliis agendis pronuntiet finitisque titulis metropolitanus episcopus concilium adloquatur dicens: Ecce, sanctissimi sacerdotes, recitatae sunt ex canonibus priorum patrum sententiae de concilio celebrando. | Thus, with all in their places sitting in silence, the deacon dressed in white, holding the book of canons in the middle, should announce the chapters concerning the councils and when the metropolitan bishop has finished reading the titles, he should address the council, saying: Behold, holy priests, the decisions concerning the council have been read according to the canons of the earlier fathers. |
| 197 | Si qua igitur quempiam vestrum actio commovet, coram suis fratribus proponat. | If any of you is moved by some action, let him present it before his brothers. |
| 197 | Tunc si aliquis quamcumque querelam, quae contra canonem agit, in audientiam sacerdotalem protulerit, non prius ad aliud transeatur capitulum, nisi primum, quae proposita est actio, terminetur. | Then, if anyone should present any complaint contrary to the canon, it should not be passed to another chapter until the matter presented is resolved first. |
| 197 | Nam et si presbyter aliquis aut diaconus vel clericus sive laicus de hiis, qui foris steterint, concilium pro qualibet re crediderit appellandum, ecclesiae metropolitanae archidiacono causam suam intimet, et ille concilio denuntiet, et tunc illi et introeundi et proponendi licentia concedatur. | For if a priest, a deacon, or a cleric or layman should believe that a council should be called for any reason, he should inform the metropolitan church's archdeacon of his case, and he should announce it to the council, and then he should be granted permission to enter and present his case. |
| 197 | Nullus enim episcoporum actu communi secedat, antequam hora generalis secessionis adveniat. | No bishop may leave the council in common action before the general hour of departure arrives. |
| 197 | Concilium quoque nullus solvere audeat, nisi fuerint cuncta determinata, ita ut, quaecumque deliberatione communi finiuntur, episcoporum singulorum manibus subscribantur. | The council should not dare to dissolve unless all matters have been determined, so that whatever is concluded by common deliberation may be signed by the hands of each bishop. |
| 197 | Tunc enim deus suorum sacerdotum interesse credendus est conventu<i>, si tumultu omni abiecto sollicite atque tranquille ecclesiastica negotia terminentur. | Then God should be believed to have been present at the assembly, if all tumult is cast aside and ecclesiastical matters are concluded with care and tranquility. |
| 198 | Ecce ordinem. | However, it is not observed in this way today. |
| 198 | Verum non ita hodie observatur. | Isidore also treats the order of holding a synod in the beginning of the book on synods. |
| 198 | Isidorus etiam in principio libri de synodis ordinem celebrand<ae> synodi tractat. | I have written this little work for this reason, because it is written at the end concerning the dissolution of the council, and also at the end it is said that God was believed to have been present at the council when ecclesiastical matters were concluded with care and tranquility. |
| 198 | Inscripsi vero huic opusculo hunc canonem ob hoc, quod circa eius finem contra dissolutionem scribitur ac etiam in ultimo dicitur, quod tunc deus credendus est interfuisse concilio, quando sollicite atque tranquille ecclesiastica negotia terminantur. | Therefore, we should accuse the end of the council, because, even if it is correctly assembled and some matters are treated justly and legitimately for a while, it is not always true to assert that Christ was in the midst, because He is not the author of discord, but of peace. |
| 198 | Quare a fine concilii arguere debemus, quoniam, etiam si recte congregatum et aliquamdiu iuste et legitime omnia sint tractata, tamen, nisi in tranquillitate terminetur, non est veraciter semper asserendum Christum in medio fuisse, quoniam ipse non est auctor discordiarum, sed pacis. | This is worth noting due to what has been written above. |
| 198 | Quod est notandum propter certa superius scripta. | Chapter XXIV. |
| 199 | Capitulum XXIV. | There are also other councils that are often called universal for one great kingdom or large province. |
| 199 | Sunt praeterea alia concilia, quae saepe universalia unius regni magni aut magnae provinciae nominantur. | These are gathered from all the particular provinces of the kingdom or nation, and they were gathered for serious common causes, as mentioned above. |
| 199 | Et talia colliguntur de omnibus particularibus provinciis regni illius aut nationis, et talia propter arduas communes causas, ut praehabitum est, congregabantur. | It was defined in the second Council of Arles that such a council should be gathered in Gaul through the Council of Arles. It is also found that it was gathered due to the request of the provinces of Gaul. |
| 199 | &laddDiffinitum fuit in secundo Arelatensi concilio, quod tale concilium per Gallias per Arelatensem congregaretur&radd, et reperitur etiam congregatum ad petitionem provinciarum Galliae. | Therefore, it is said at the beginning of that council: "When we, the priests, assembled at the city of Tours at the request of the provinces of Gaul and considered the matter with the Lord or mediator in the church of that city, etc." And as Spain and France were under one king at times, as they were when the Goths ruled, King Recared, Sisenand, and others, such universal councils were held in Toledo according to royal edict, just as we read about the universal councils of the universal church, how they were gathered by emperors, and kings often participated in them with their nobles and subscribed to the Catholic faith. |
| 199 | Unde dicitur in principio illius concilii: «Cum ad postulationem provinciarum Galliae sacerdotes convenissemus ad Taurinantium civitatem atque in eiusdem civitatis ecclesia auctore domino vel mediatore consideremus etc. | Many solemn decrees and statutes concerning the election of the king, how he should be established, and other royal statutes, especially concerning the preservation of his life, are found. |
| 199 | » Et ut frequenter tempore, quo sub uno rege erant Hispania et Francia, sicut tempore, quo Gothi regnabant, Recaredus rex, Sisenandus et alii, tunc illa universalia concilia ex edicto regio in Toleto celebrabantur recte ad instar sicut de universalibus universalis ecclesiae legimus, quomodo per imperatores colligebantur, et solebant reges cum suis proceribus illis saepe interesse et fidei catholicae se subscribere. | These will be seen below. |
| 200 | Et multa inveniuntur solempnia edita statuta de electione regis, quomodo per electionem constitui debeat, et alia statum regium respicientia, maxime circa conservationem vitae eius. | And many ecclesiastical canons were also established in these councils. |
| 200 | De quibus inferius videbitur. | In the council held during the reign of Sisenand, it is read in the third chapter that the universal synod, due to the decrees of the fathers, who wished that one use of psalming and ministering should be in the province, because at that time Gaul and Spain were united in faith and one kingdom, decreed that the same rite should be observed. |
| 200 | Ac etiam ecclesiastici canones multi in ipsis conditi sunt. | And many ecclesiastical canons were established in them. |
| 200 | Et in concilio celebrato tempore Sisenandi tertio capitulo legitur, quomodo universalis illa synodus propter decreta patrum, quae volunt unum debere usum psallendi et ministrandi esse in provincia, quia tunc Gallia et Hispania una fide et uno regno continebantur, statuerunt eundem ritum servari debere. | And in the council held in the time of Sisenand, in the third chapter, it is read how that universal synod, because of the decrees of the fathers, who desired that there should be one usage of singing and ministering in the province, since Gaul and Spain were then united in one faith and one kingdom, decreed that the same rite should be observed. |
| 201 | Inveniuntur omnia in illis conciliis diffinita tam ad fidem quam ad quascumque magnas causas pertinentia. | All matters concerning faith as well as significant issues are found defined in those councils, both for the faith and for the great causes at hand. |
| 201 | Et semper in principio fides recitabatur. | And faith was always recited at the beginning. |
| 201 | Legitur enim in concilio Toletano tempore Chintilani celebrato quod more synodi universalis post solempnia perfunctae orationis fidem, quam intrinsece ruminabant, voce eructabant. | It is read in the Council of Toledo, celebrated in the time of Chintilanus, that in accordance with the universal synod's custom, after the solemn conclusion of the sermon, they outwardly declared the faith they had inwardly pondered through vocal proclamation. |
| 201 | Et in alio Sisenandi tempore celebrato: «Et quia generale concilium agimus, oportet primum nostri sermonis vocem de deo esse, ut post professionem fidei sequentia operis nostri vota quasi supra firmamentum firmissimum disponantur. | And in another session of the Council of Seville, celebrated: "Since we are acting as a general council, it must first be that our language of speech regarding God be foremost; so that after the profession of faith, the intentions of our prayers, like mountains on the most solid foundation, may be laid. |
| 201 | » Legitur contendentes de primatu in ipsis diffinitionem recepisse. | " It is noted that those contesting the primacy took up the definition within these very declarations. |
| 201 | Unde in Taurinantium concilio scribitur: «Illud deinde inter episcopos urbium Arelatensis et Viennensis, quae de primatus apud nos honore certabant, a sancta synodo diffinitum est. | Thus, in the Council of Turin, it is written: "The issue between the bishops of Aix and Vienna, who contended for primacy among us, was defined by the holy synod. |
| 201 | » Cognovit de appellationibus et sententiis latis in conciliis provincialibus, ut in gestis eiusdem concilii de Exsuperantio presbytero pro parte Triferii episcopi iudicato et Palladio laico contra Spanum presbyterum, cui grave crimen imposuit, legitur. | " It is known from the appeals and decrees in provincial councils, as seen in the actions of the council of Exsuperantius concerning the presbyter Probus, judged against Palladius the layman and Spanus the presbyter, to whom a grave charge was imposed, as recorded therein. |
| 201 | Natio enim Africana talia universalia concilia celebravit, ad quae de aliis appellabatur, ut scribit idem concilium in epistula ad Caelestinum papam, et omnia diffinit, etiam translationes episcoporum, ut in 27 capitulo eiusdem concilii habetur, et privationes episcoporum, et noluit quod ad papam a sententia illius concilii appellaretur, sed dixit terminari ibi causas debere iuxta diffinitionem Nicaeni concilii, ut scribit idem concilium ad Bonifatium et Zosimum Romanos pontifices. | For the African Church convened such general councils, to which others referred, as stated in the same council's letter to Pope Caelestine, defining all matters, including translations of bishops, as noted in Chapter 27 of this council, and deprivations of bishops, and it did not wish to be subject to the decision of that council but declared that causes should be concluded according to the Nicaean council's definition, as recorded in the same council's letters to Boniface and Zosimus, the Roman pontiffs. |
| 201 | Et hoc concilium hoc ordine annue in octavo capitulo eiusdem Africani concilii iubebatur celebrari: «Placuit, ut propter ecclesiasticas causas, quae ad perniciem plebium saepe veterascunt, singulis quibusque annis concilium vocetur, ad quod omnes provinciae, quae primas sedes habent, de conciliis suis binos aut quantos elegerint episcopos legatos mittant, ut et minus invidiosi minusque hospitibus sumptuosi exsistant, ut congregato conventu plena possit esse auctoritas. | This council thus ordered in the eighth chapter of the African council: "It was agreed that for ecclesiastical causes, which often endanger the populace, a council should be convened annually; to which all provinces sending two or as many bishops as they deem fit as delegates, so as not to appear envious nor overly lavish in hospitality, might assemble with full authority. |
| 201 | De Tripoli autem propter inopiam episcoporum unus episcopus veniat. | Concerning Tripoli, however, due to a lack of bishops, one bishop alone was to come. |
| 201 | » Iste textus est notandus in duobus: Primo, quod sedes provinciae vocatur prima sedes; secundo, quod legati provinciarum praestant auctoritatem nomine provinciae concilio, quod pro cardinalibus et hiis, quae superius dicta sunt, notari debet. | " This text is notable for two things: first, that the province's seat is called the first seat; second, that provincial delegates exercise authority under the province's name in the council, something akin to cardinals and previously noted matters. |
| 201 | Post hoc fuit sublatum istud decretum in Milevitano concilio, ne fratres nimium fatigarentur, et fuit statutum, ut non nisi pro necessaria communi causa convocaretur hoc generale concilium. | After this, this decree was removed at the Council of Mileve, lest the brethren be overly fatigued, and it was established that such a general council should not be convened save for necessary communal causes. |
| 202 | Insuper congregato universali concilio tali, si tunc multae restabant causae tractandae et multi interfuere episcopi, quaelibet provincia vices aliquibus commisit et alii recesserunt. | Moreover, when such a universal council convened and many causes remained to be addressed with many bishops present, each province assigned tasks to some and others withdrew. |
| 202 | Ita legitur in concilio Milevitano c. | Thus, it is read in the Council of Mileve, Chapter 29: "Furthermore, it was agreed that the entire episcopate gathered for the council should not be bound to judge for three from each province indefinitely; and elected were Vincent, Fortunatus, and Clarus from the province of Carthage, Alipius, Augustine, and Restitutus from Numidia", and so forth for others, adding: "All these confirmed with holy old Aurelius and subscribed by all. |
| 202 | 29: «Item placuit, ne diutius universi episcopi, qui ad concilium congregati sunt, tenerentur, ab universo concilio iudices ternos de singulis provinciis eligi; et electi sunt de provincia Carthaginensi Vincentius, Fortunatus et Clarus, de provincia Numidiae Alipius, Augustinus et Restitutus», et sic de aliis, et additur: «Qui omnes cum sancto sene Aurelio universa cognoscant, et subscripserunt universi». | It is noteworthy when a restricted council with universal authority should be constituted, vicarii should be elected from each subject or synod-relevant area. |
| 202 | Ex hoc est notandum, quando constitui debet concilium restrictum potestatem universam habens, per vicetenentes de singulis subiectis vel ad synodum spectantibus constitui debet. | Therefore, this should apply to cardinals who govern the provinces subordinate to the Roman Church in daily council. |
| 202 | Quare ita in cardinalibus fieri deberet, qui vices provinciarum, quae subsunt Romanae ecclesiae, in quotidiano concilio gerunt. | Moreover, since universal councils of the Church exceed provincial ones in authority, as evident from the preceding texts and supported by the texts of the Council of Laodicea and Martin's papacy and others, chapter 6, q. |
| 202 | Quod autem ista universalia concilia maioris auctoritatis sunt quam provincialia, quae eis subsunt, ex superioribus patet, et probant textus concilii Laodicensis et Martini papae et alii, qui habentur 6 q. | 4., Capitulum XXV. |
| 202 | 4. | And it is to be considered that, although from the decree of the Second Council of Arles, in which legates of Pope Silvester participated, the synod was to be convened at Arelatensis episcopus' petition, yet in the Taurinensis council, it is found judged similarly concerning the question held with Vienna on primacy. |
| 203 | Capitulum XXV. | Thus, Carthaginensis was not exempted from that synod's judgment, even though he had convened it and been prior thereto, because the Nicaen definition was undoubtedly applied in Africa in that council to conclude all matters, as q. |
| 203 | Et est considerandum quod, licet ex decreto concilii Arelatensis secundi, in quo legati Silvestri papae interfuere, ad petitionem Arelatensis episcopi synodus celebrari deberet, tamen in Tauritano concilio invenitur de eodem iudicatum in quaestione, quam cum Viennensi de primatu habebat. | 6 Placuit. |
| 203 | Sic Carthaginensis non fuit a iudicio illius synodi Africanae exemptus, licet ipse convocaverit et prior in eo fuerit, quia indubitata fuit illa diffinitio Nicaeni concilii omnia exorta in Africa in illo concilio terminari debere, ut 2 q. | And although the text speaks of the provincial council of Africa as to general or primatial, not excepting the pope transmarine, yet c. |
| 203 | 6 Placuit. | Placuit eiusdem concilii and idem cum primo 11 q. |
| 203 | Et licet ille textus dicat de provinciali Africano ad generale vel primatem, non ad transmarinum excepto papa appellari debere, tamen c. | 3 Placuit does not exclude the pope, because the original does not exclude him. |
| 203 | Placuit eiusdem concilii et idem cum primo 11 q. | Indeed, the first text q. |
| 203 | 3 Placuit non excipit papam, quia originale non excipit. | 6 is false, and much could be adduced regarding these points. |
| 203 | Immo primus textus 2 q. | Thus, there was never any doubt at that time that all patriarchal councils, including those of the Roman See, were subject to the universal council of the Church. |
| 203 | 6 falsus est, et multa de hiis adduci possent. | Nor because some patriarchs from the ordination of any of that universal Church's councils had the power to convene such general councils, as Athanasius writes, who, though not yet an episcope at the Nicaean Council but worthy thereof, states that Pope Felix conferred upon the Roman pontiff the authority to convene the Nicaean council, such patriarchs as Arelatensis or Carthaginensis would have been exempt from its jurisdiction, as previously noted. |
| 203 | Et sic de universali universalis ecclesiae concilio pariformiter nullum tunc fuit dubium, quin ei subessent omnia patriarchalia etiam Romanae sedis concilia. | Just as the authority of universal council presidents of kingdoms or nations does not depend on the conveners, so the authority of the universal Church council is not dependent on who convenes it, provided it is convened by the pope, for then it would not be a valid council, since otherwise the eight universal councils would not be firm. |
| 203 | Nec propter hoc, quod aliquis patriarcharum ex ordinatione alicuius illius universalis ecclesiae concilii potestatem convocandi universalia talia concilia habuisset, sicut scribit Athanasius, qui Nicaeno concilio nondum tunc episcopus, sed dignus episcopatu interfuit, ad Felicem papam Nicaenum concilium Romano pontifici congregandi hanc synodum potestatem dedisse, fuisset exemptus a iurisdictione ipsius synodi, sicut nec Arelatensis nec Carthaginensis primates, ut praehabitum est. | For such councils convened by emperors or received papal mandates are accepted as legitimate. |
| 203 | Et sicut auctoritas praefatorum universalium conciliorum regni vel nationis a congregante non dependit, sic quod ibi non fuisset auctoritas plena, nisi per ipsum deputatum convocatio facta fuisset, quoniam multa talia concilia legimus absque illorum convocatione celebrata et accepta, ita dicendum de universalis ecclesiae concilio, quod eius auctoritas non ita dependet a congregante, quod, nisi per papam congregaretur, quod tunc non foret concilium, quia tunc non fuissent omnia octo universalia concilia firma, quoniam per imperatores congregata leguntur et Romanos pontifices ad instar aliorum patriarcharum divales sacras iussiones pro veniendo aut mittendo ad concilium recepisse. | And this is evident from it that the authority to convene a council, once given by any council, ceases upon the convened council's assembly, whatever its nature. |
| 204 | Et hoc est ex hoc manifestum, quoniam auctoritas de congregando concilio a concilio cuicumque data cessat congregato iam concilio qualitercumque. | Yet, a convened council wields the authority to convene through commission when deemed expedient, and upon assembling, the commission is fulfilled. |
| 204 | Sed concilio non congregato hoc operatur auctoritas quod eam a concilio habens, quando iuxta commissionem sibi expediri visum est, potestatem habet congregandi, et cum congregatum est, expleta est commissio. | If, however, many were to convene without the authority to convene or without being duly summoned or otherwise, it would be an imperfect council. |
| 204 | Si vero absque auctoritate habentis congregare convenirent plures spreto aut non admisso commissario vel eo non vocato, iuxta praehabita imperfectum esset concilium. | But if necessity for convening a council were intimated to a commissioned holder without concern for convening or gathering with others to address arising needs, provided otherwise it were rightly celebrated: who would doubt their ability to provide for the fluctuating church, disregarding such obstacles? |
| 204 | Sed si intimaretur necessitas congregandi concilii commissionem habenti nec curaret congregare nec convenire cum aliis ad providendum necessitatibus occurrentibus, dummodo alias rite celebraretur: quis dubitaret praesentes fluctuanti ecclesiae illis non obstantibus providere posse? | For necessity, which knows no law, solves all positive legal arguments, whatever they may be, ensuring the church's healthy provision. |
| 204 | Necessitas enim, quae legem non habet, omnia argumenta positivi iuris, qualitercumque fieri possent, in contrarium tunc solvit, ut ecclesiae dei salubriter provideatur. | For necessity, which has no law, at that time dissolved all arguments of positive law, however they might be made, to the contrary, so that the church of God might be provided for salutarily. |
| 205 | Et in hac materia opus est reformation<e> quoad ea, quae expediri debent in ipsis provincialibus et universalibus regni aut nationis alicuius synodis, ut canon Sardicensis concilii, qui habetur 2 q. | And in this matter, a reformation is needed as regards those things that must be expedited in the provincial and universal synods of any kingdom or nation, such as the canon of the Sardican Council, which is held in 2 q. |
| 205 | 6, scilicet quod omnia in illis conciliis, qualitercumque orirentur, etiam depositiones episcoporum, in ipsis expedirentur et interpositis appellationibus ad apostolicam sedem, quod tunc nihilominus in loco, ubi causa ortum habuit, datis propriis apostolicis commissariis in synodo expedirentur omnes causae iuxta formam ibi positam. | 6, namely that all matters arising in those councils, including the deposition of bishops, were to be expedited within them and, after appeals to the apostolic see, were to be resolved by the apostolic commissaries in the synod itself, as then nothing was to be done in the place where the cause arose, but all causes were to be resolved according to the form established there. |
| 205 | Estque etiam multum opportunum provincialia concilia continuari indefectibiliter et de suffraganeorum concilio non ad papam primo, sed provincialem synodum, si opus fuerit, interponi posse appellationem vel ad universalia nationalia concilia Gallicana, Hispanica et Germanica. | It is also very opportune for provincial councils to be continued indefectibly and for an appeal to be made, if necessary, not to the pope first, but to the provincial synod, and if necessary, to the universal national councils of the Gauls, Spaniards, and Germans. |
| 205 | Quae omni studio pro conservanda re publica ac pace patriae mutuaque caritate reinstitui opus foret. | Which would be the work of all diligence for the preservation of the republic and the peace of the fatherland and mutual charity. |
| 206 | Nec debet Romanus pontifex hanc ordinationem aegre ferre, cum, ut scribunt Africani concilii patres ad Caelestinum papam, «decreta Nicaena sive inferioris gradus clericos sive ipsos episcopos suis metropolitanis apertissime commiserunt. | Nor should the Roman pontiff bear this ordinance with difficulty, since, as the fathers of the African councils write to Pope Caelestinus, "the decrees of Nicaea or of a lower grade of clergy or even bishops were entrusted to their metropolitan bishops in the most open manner. |
| 206 | Prudentissime enim iustissimeque viderunt quaecumque negotia in suis locis, ubi orta sunt, finienda nec unicuique providentiam sancti spiritus defuturam, quoniam aequitas a Christi sacerdotibus et prudenter videatur et constantissime teneatur, maxime quia unicuique concessum est, si iudicio offensus fuerit cognitorum, ad concilia suae provinciae vel etiam universale provocare, nisi forte quisquam sit, qui credat unicuilibet posse deum nostrum examinis inspirare iustitiam et innumeralibus congregatis in concilium sacerdotibus denegare. | For they wisely and justly saw that all matters arising in their places of origin were to be settled, and that no one would be lacking in the providence of the holy spirit, since equity is to be seen and held by Christ's priests in a prudent and constant manner, especially since each one is granted the right to appeal to the councils of their province or even to the universal one, unless perhaps someone believes that our God can inspire justice in each one and deny it to the multitude gathered in the council. |
| 206 | » Haec ibi. | "This is what is written there. |
| 207 | Quare contentari merito debet Romanus pontifex, si res per concilia eo ordine tractantur, et non debet ad suum examen ita cuncta advocare et suum iudicium multis sacerdotibus auctoritatem ex divino iure et Nicaeno concilio diffiniendi et terminandi habentibus praeponere. | Therefore, the Roman pontiff should be content if matters are treated in this order by the councils, and he should not summon all these things to his own judgment and prefer his own judgment to the authority of many priests who have the power of defining and terminating from divine law and the Council of Nicaea. |
| 207 | Sufficere merito debet Romanus pontifex, si Sardicense concilium supra allegatum, quod per legatos apostolicae sedis Faustinum et alios fuit pro statuto Nicaeni concilii in Africana synodo false allegatum et non acceptatum per eandem, ut in epistula eiusdem concilii ad papam Bonifatium et praefata epistula ad Caelestinum haec patent, per has omnes provincias acceptetur. | It is sufficient for the Roman pontiff to be content if the Sardican Council, which is cited above, is accepted by all these provinces, which was falsely alleged and not accepted by the same, as is evident from the letter of the same council to Pope Boniface and the aforementioned letter to Caelestinus, was established by the apostolic legates Faustinus and others according to the statute of the Council of Nicaea in the African synod. |
| 207 | Verum est ipsos patres Africani concilii, in quo et sanctus interfuit Augustinus, in praefata ad Caelestinum epistula scribere hanc constitutionem, quam Gratianus Sardicensi concilio ascribit, nulla patrum synodo invenisse constitutam. | For it is true that the fathers of the African council, in which Saint Augustine also participated, wrote in the aforementioned letter to Caelestinus that this constitution, which Gratian attributes to the Sardican Council, was not found established by any synod of fathers. |
| 207 | Quare satis posset dubitari, an Sardicensis concilii constitutio exsistat. | Therefore, it can be doubted whether the constitution of the Sardican Council exists. |
| 207 | Quare a fortiori papa contentari deberet, si ipsam, quam Africana synodus non admisit, constitutionem omni parte, an sit alicuius concilii et cuius, dubiam, pro honore sanctae Romanae ecclesiae acceptamus. | Therefore, the pope should be all the more content if the very constitution, which the African synod did not admit, is accepted in its entirety, whether it is from any council and which one, we accept it as doubtful for the honor of the holy Roman Church. |
| 207 | Et in hiis ac aliis sancta haec synodus medium proportionatum loco et tempori tale deo duce inveniet, ut, si qua vitia ex oboedientia nimia exorta sunt iuxta doctrinam sancti Gregorii, 2 q. | And in these and other matters, this holy synod will find a proportionate and suitable middle ground, led by God, so that, if any vices have arisen from excessive obedience, following the doctrine of Saint Gregory, 2 q. |
| 207 | 7 Admonendi, non foveantur amplius, sed resistatur, ut in c. | 7, they are to be admonished, not encouraged, but resisted, as in c. |
| 207 | Sancta quippe, qui est textus sancti Hieronymi ibidem, et 11 q. | For it is holy, which is the text of Saint Jerome ibidem, and 11 q. |
| 207 | 3 Quod ergo, <86> di. | 3, what then,  di. |
| 207 | Quando. | When. |
| 207 | Et haec pro hac materia sufficiant. | And these are sufficient for this matter. |
| 208 | Capitulum XXVI. | Chapter XXVI. |
| 208 | Superest, ut de paucis ad reformationem facientibus mentionem faciamus. | It remains for us to mention a few who are working towards reformation. |
| 208 | Digressio enim a forma per patres nobis tradita difformitatem in ecclesia causavit, quoniam non quisque recte usus est sua potestate. | For a digression from the form handed down by the fathers caused the diversity in the Church, since not everyone used their power correctly. |
| 208 | Esset itaque de potestate ecclesiastica videndum, de qua multi eleganter scripserunt, ac deinde, quid recte conveniat cuique potestati praesidentiali in gradu suo, ut sic visa vera forma et excessu abusus reductio per proportionata media tempori congrua fieret. | Therefore, it would be necessary to consider the power of the Church, about which many have written elegantly, and then to consider what is fitting for each presbyterial power in its own grade, so that the true form may be seen and the excess reduced by proportionate means suitable to the time. |
| 208 | Haec profunda et lata sunt, ideo non possunt facile compendiose perstringi. | These are profound and wide-ranging matters, therefore they cannot be easily and briefly summarized. |
| 208 | Unde de potestate distributiva sacramentorum et dispensatione verbi credita sacerdotio primo multa dici oporteret. | Hence, many things would have to be said about the distributive power of sacraments and the dispensation of the word believed to be entrusted to the priesthood first. |
| 208 | Sufficiat nunc, quod ministri et dispensatores ministeriorum sciunt se nuntios, angelos et Christi legatos cum hac commissione esse, ut omnia discrete ad dei honorem et populi salutem peragant, ut est praeceptum Innocentii, 90 di. | It is sufficient now that ministers and dispensers of ministries know that they are messengers, angels, and Christ's legates with this commission, to carry out all things discreetly for the honor of God and the salvation of the people, as is the precept of Innocentius, 90 di. |
| 208 | Praecipimus. | We command. |
| 209 | Dum haec ita agunt &ladddiscreti&radd dispensatores libertate credita ad hos praetactos fines utendo, etiam si alii aliter dispensent, dummodo dispensandi modus traditus per ecclesiam restricte limitatus non exsistat, talento credito recte &laddutitur&radd, uti sanctus Cyprianus ad Antonianum et Augustinus post eum ad Vincentium Rogatistam de certis episcopis, qui moechos ad poenitentiam numquam admiserunt aliis admittentibus, scribunt, quos tamen eapropter ab episcoporum suorum collegio negant recessisse vel catholicae ecclesiae unitatem duritie censurae seu obstinatia rupisse, ut, quia apud alios adulteris pax daretur, qui non dabat, de ecclesia separaretur. | While they act in this way and the dispensers, credited with liberty, use these limits, even if others dispense differently, as long as the mode of dispensation is not restricted by the Church, the talent is credited rightly, as Saint Cyprian writes to Antonianus and Augustine after him to Vincentius Rogatistus about certain bishops who never admitted moechos to penance while others admitted them, whom they nonetheless deny to have separated from the college of their bishops or to have broken the unity of the Catholic Church because, because peace was given to adulterers by others, who did not give it, they were separated from the Church. |
| 209 | «Manente enim concordiae vinculo et perseverante ecclesiae catholicae individuo sacramento actum suum disponit et dirigit unusquisque episcopus rationem propositi sui domino redditurus. | "For as long as the bond of concord remains and the Catholic Church perseveres in its indivisible sacrament, each bishop disposes and directs his own action, rendering an account of his intention to his Lord. |
| 209 | » Haec ibi. | "This is what is written there. |
| 209 | Et est sententia sancti Cypriani in variis locis. | And this is the opinion of Saint Cyprian in various places. |
| 209 | Unde varietas dispensationis, quae propter disciplinam rigorosa fuit antiquitus et post hoc laxata, semper fuit in libera dispensatione sacerdotii ad praetactos fines. | Hence, the variety of dispensation, which was once rigorous due to discipline and later relaxed, has always been in the free dispensation of the priesthood within the limits mentioned. |
| 209 | Quondam enim lapsis non dabatur venia nec spes communionis etiam in extremis, De poenitentia di. | For formerly, no pardon was given to those who had lapsed, nor was there even hope of communion, even in the last moments, De poenitentia di. |
| 209 | 7 Hoc autem, quousque in unum convenit sacerdotium et scripturis ab utraque parte prolatis temperamentum salubri moderatione inveniretur, scilicet ut in articulo mortis daretur, de quo late per Cyprianum ad Antoni<a>num. | 7, but this, as long as the priesthood comes together and a salubrious moderation is found in the scriptures from both sides, namely, that in the article of death, as is written widely by Cyprian to Antonianus. |
| 209 | De quo etiam De poenitentia di. | And also in De poenitentia di. |
| 209 | 3 In tantum et multis textibus ibidem. | 3, in many texts ibidem. |
| 209 | Et Innocentius papa scribit, quomodo «consuetudo anterior habuit, ut concederetur poenitentia et negaretur communio. | And Pope Innocentius writes how "the custom of old had it that pardon was given and communion was denied. |
| 209 | Propter crebras persecutiones concessa poenitentia et negata communio fuit, ut, qui passim ad poenitentiam admitterentur, in hoc saltem punirentur, ut de reconciliatione securos revocaret per hoc a lapsu. | Because of frequent persecutions, pardon was granted and communion was denied, so that those who were admitted to penance might at least be punished by this, so that they might be recalled from their lapse by this means of reconciliation. |
| 209 | Hodie autem, quia pax data est ecclesiae, observatio prior durior facta est inclinatior, ut et ad poenitentiam admittantur simul et ad ultimum viaticum». | But today, since peace has been given to the Church, the stricter observation of the earlier custom has become more inclined, so that both those who are admitted to penance and those who are admitted to the final viaticum. |
| 209 | Haec ille. | This is what he says. |
| 210 | Illas omnes varietates annotare supervacuum hoc loco esset. | It would be superfluous to note all these varieties in this place. |
| 210 | Scimus in Sardicensi concilio, quod tota universalis ecclesia recepit, ut habetur in gestis octavi concilii, statutum ambitiosos etiam in extremo mortis articulo ad communionem non debere admitti, licet Nicaenum concilium omnem facinorosum ad ultimum viaticum admitti iubeat. | We know that the Sardican Council, which the whole universal Church received, as is written in the acts of the eighth council, established the statute that even ambitious people should not be admitted to communion in the last article of death, although the Council of Nicaea orders that all guilty people be admitted to the final viaticum. |
| 210 | &laddSimiliter in ultimo capitulo concilii Carthaginensis, cui se Augustinus subscripsit, mandatur communionem numquam dari illis, qui emisso voto castitatis et assumpto habitu post hoc redierunt ad saeculum et contraxerunt. | Similarly, in the last chapter of the Council of Carthage, to which Augustine subscribed, it is commanded that communion should never be given to those who, having taken a vow of chastity and having assumed the habit, returned to the world and contracted. |
| 210 | &radd Ex quo et aliis multis hoc saltem habetur libertatem traditae potestatis in dandis et distribuendis sacramentis ad fines praedictos apud sacerdotium esse dandi et non dandi secundum locum et tempus et dispositionem subditorum. | From which it also happens that, just as communion is salutary and medicinal, so too excommunication is medicinal for obedience, to which all faithful are bound in this matter, 11 q. |
| 210 | Ex quo evenit, ut, sicut communicare est salutare et medicinale, sic et excommunicatio est medicinalis propter oboedientiam, ad quam omnes fideles tenentur in hoc maxime 11 q. | 3, if, however, and c. |
| 210 | 3 Si autem et c. | Far be it. |
| 210 | Absit. | For it is thus written that Saint Peter is read to have said to Clement: "It is necessary for the one who presides to act as a doctor, etc. |
| 210 | Ita enim sanctus Petrus legitur ad Clementem dixisse: «Oportet eum qui praeest vicem medici agere etc. | " |
| 210 | De quo in epistula Clementis ad Iacobum, fratrem domini. | Concerning which, in the letter of Clement to James, the brother of the Lord. |
| 211 | Unde clare habetur Bohemos non recte sapere, quod communio sub utraque specie quoad laicos de necessitate salutis exsistat, quia cum laici per se capere communionem non possint, et cum sacerdotio credita sit potestas distribuendi, sic quod dare et non dare possit ad fines praedictos, sicut docent etiam praedicta exempla, quomodo tunc laici ad impossibile obligarentur. | From this it is clearly held that the Bohemians are wrong in believing that communion under both kinds is necessary for salvation for the laity, because since the laity cannot by themselves receive communion, and since the power of distributing it is entrusted to the priesthood, such that it can give or not give it for the aforementioned reasons, as the aforementioned examples also teach, how then would the laity be bound to the impossible? |
| 211 | Et si dicunt quod sacerdotium praecepto Christi distribuere teneatur, dicant, quomodo stetit ecclesia in Christi praeceptis ante Innocentium papam, quando consuetudo fuit non dandi. | And if they say that the priesthood is bound by Christ's precept to distribute [communion], let them say how the Church stood in Christ's precepts before Pope Innocent, when the custom was not to give [communion]. |
| 211 | Deinde in tempore Cypriani et Cornelii papae, quando lapsis non dabatur, et tempore Sardicensis concilii, quando ambitiosis denegabatur, et illo tempore, quando moechis &laddet transgressoribus voti castitatis et tempore Eliberitani concilii, ut habetur in c. | Then in the time of Cyprian and Pope Cornelius, when it was not given to the lapsed, and at the time of the Council of Sardica, when it was denied to the ambitious, and at that time when it was denied to adulterers and transgressors of the vow of chastity, and at the time of the Council of Elvira, as is found in c. |
| 211 | 63 eiusdem, quando adulteris puerum interficientibus etiam in extremis constitutis non dabatur, et deficientibus in accusatione gravi criminis presbyteri vel episcopi, ut in eodem concilio c. | 63 of the same, when it was not given even to adulterers who killed a child, even those in their final moments, and to those deficient in the accusation of a serious crime of a presbyter or bishop, as in the same council c. |
| 211 | 75 et stupratoribus puerorum, ut in c. | 75, and to those who violated boys, as in c. |
| 211 | 71, et mulieri alium virum quam illum cum quo moechata fuit ducenti, ut in 72 c. | 71, and to a woman marrying a man other than the one with whom she committed adultery, as in c. 72. |
| 211 | habetur, omnibus etiam in fine vitae communio&radd non dabatur. | it is held, communion was not given to all, even at the end of life. |
| 211 | Et iam longo tempore, quando sub una specie datur, si praeceptum esset distribuere sub utraque specie, non esset verum, quod maior pars sacerdotum et episcoporum secundum sententiam Christi, ut scribit sanctus Cyprianus, in vera fide et lege Christi semper stetisset, ut superius tetigi. | And for a long time, when it is given under one kind, if it were a precept to distribute under both kinds, it would not be true that the majority of priests and bishops, according to the opinion of St. Cyprian, always stood in the true faith and law of Christ, as I touched upon above. |
| 211 | Et collegi late ex canone Bibliae et canonibus conciliorum et doctorum scripturis auctoritates hoc probantes, quomodo irrestricte liberrime apud sacerdotium est potestas distributiva huius sacramenti eucharistiae in quodam opusculo contra hunc Bohemorum errorem. | And I have gathered extensively from the canon of the Bible and the canons of councils and the writings of the doctors authorities proving this, how unrestrictedly and freely the power of distributing this sacrament of the Eucharist is in the priesthood, in a certain work against this error of the Bohemians. |
| 211 | Quare nunc ista missa faciamus. | Therefore, let us now celebrate this Mass. |
| 212 | Sufficiant ista, quia praesentis speculationis non sunt. | Let these things suffice, because they are not of the present discussion. |
| 212 | Sufficit scire apud sacerdotium hic congregatum liberam potestatem esse ordinandi commissam distributivam curam in laudem dei et populi salutem, ordinationibus et consuetudinibus variis non obstantibus. | It suffices to know that the priesthood gathered here has the free power of ordering entrusted to it, the distributive care for the praise of God and the salvation of the people, notwithstanding various ordinances and customs. |

| 213 | 7 Sicut inquit, a capite incipiendum est in concilio reformatorio; hoc suprascriptio coniuncta textui probat. | 7 As he says, one must begin at the head in a reforming council; this superscription joined to the text proves this. |
| 213 | Unde, si ita fit, ut omnis potestas regulis per universalia concilia traditis in suo regimine utatur, necessario optima reformatio sequitur. | Therefore, if it happens that all power uses rules handed down by universal councils in its governance, necessarily the best reformation follows. |
| 213 | Sic enim scribit Leo papa ad Constantinum, Audentium, Rusticum etc. | For thus Pope Leo writes to Constantine, Audentius, Rusticus, etc. |
| 213 | : «Iusta et rationabilis causa gaudendi est, cum a sacerdotibus domini ea gesta cognoscimus, quae et paternorum canonum regulis et apostolicis congruant institutis. | : "There is just and reasonable cause for rejoicing when we learn from the priests of the Lord those things which are in accordance with the rules of paternal canons and apostolic institutions. |
| 213 | Necesse est enim, ut omne corpus ecclesiae salubri crescat unguento, si membra, quae praesunt, et vigore excellant auctoritatis et tranquillitate moderaminis. | For it is necessary that the whole body of the Church grow with wholesome ointment, if the members who preside excel both in the strength of authority and in the tranquility of moderation. |
| 213 | » Haec ille. | " He said this. |
| 214 | Unde secundum Leonem Nonum, ut superius habetur, membra omnia unius ecclesiae et corporis Christi mystici habent sua singularia officia, in quibus per alia impediri absque ordinis turbatione non possunt, 89 di. | Therefore, according to Leo IX, as is held above, all the members of the one Church and mystical body of Christ have their own particular offices, in which they cannot be hindered by others without disturbing the order, 89 d. |
| 214 | Singula. | Singular. |
| 214 | Turbatio autem ordinis est totius colligantiae ecclesiasticae unionis turbatio, et ex illo difformitas et languor in totum corpus diffunditur, 11 q. | But the disturbance of order is the disturbance of the whole connection of ecclesiastical union, and from it deformity and weakness spread throughout the whole body, 11 q. |

| 214 | Ecce. | Behold. |
| 214 | Et textus Gregorii Singula dicit: «Noxium simulque turpissimum est unum membrum alterius officium usurpare et ministeria singulariter non distribuere. | And the text of Gregory Singular says: "It is harmful and shameful for one member to usurp the office of another and not to distribute ministries individually. |
| 214 | Igitur nec caput nec membrum aliud quodcumque usurpandi potestatem alterius membri habet, si sanum et vivax absque negligentia fuerit illud, cuius officium usurpatur, absque totius corporis laesiva turbatione. | Therefore, neither the head nor any other member whatsoever has the power to usurp the office of another member, if that whose office is usurped is healthy and vigorous without negligence, without the harmful disturbance of the whole body. |
| 214 | » Quare, si sciverimus, quae cuique membro ex antiquorum regulis conveniunt, videbimus, unde corpus ecclesiae deformatum exsistit. | " Therefore, if we know what is fitting for each member from the ancient rules, we shall see whence the deformed body of the Church arises. |
| 214 | Non enim deformatum foret, nisi excessus et abusus intervenisset. | For it would not be deformed unless excess and abuse had intervened. |
| 214 | Et quia, dum caput aegrotat, cetera membra dolent, hinc integritas praesidentium salus est subditorum, 61 di. | And because, when the head is sick, the other members suffer, hence the integrity of those who preside is the salvation of the subjects, 61 d. |
| 214 | Miramur, 86 di. | We marvel, 86 d. |
| 214 | Inferiorum. | Inferiors. |
| 214 | Quare nulla maior difformitas ab aliquo poterit exoriri quam ab illo, qui suae magnae potestatis intuitu licere sibi cuncta credens in subditorum iura prorumpit. | Therefore, no greater deformity can arise from anyone than from him who, believing that everything is permitted to him because of his great power, bursts forth into the rights of his subjects. |

| 215 | Unde sententia Calcedonensis concilii super allegationibus tam Romanae quam Constantinopolitanae ecclesiarum primatu sic canit: «Ex hiis, quae gesta sunt vel ab unoquoque deposita, perpendimus ante omnia &laddquidem&radd primatum et honorem praecipuum secundum canones antiquae Romae reverendissimo episcopo servari; oportere autem reverendissimum archiepiscopum regiae Constantinopolis urbis novae Romae eisdem primatus honoribus dignum esse et potestatem habere ordinare episcopos in Asiana, Pontica et Thracia dioecesibus secundum hunc modum, ut decreto facto a clericis uniuscuiusque metropolis et possessoribus atque clarissimis, super haec et a reverendissimis episcopis provinciae omnibus aut plurimis eligi, quemcumque praefatae metropolitanae ecclesiae dignum esse probaverint; referri autem ab omnibus eligentibus sanctissimo archiepiscopo Constantinopolitano, utrum sic, si velit, hunc qui electus est deductum hic ordinare, an secundum eius permissionem in provincia episcopatus mereri decretum; uniuscuiusque &laddtamen&radd civitatis episcopus ab omnibus ordinari aut plurimis provinciae reverendissimis episcopis potestatem habente metropolitano secundum patrum regulam diffinitam, nihil communicante in illorum ordinationibus reverendissimo archiepiscopo Constantinopoleos. | Therefore, the sentence of the Chalcedonian council concerning the allegations of the primacy of both the Roman and Constantinopolitan churches sings thus: "From these things which have been done or deposited by each, we consider above all that the primacy and chief honor should be preserved according to the canons for the most reverend bishop of ancient Rome; but the most reverend archbishop of the royal city of Constantinople, New Rome, should be worthy of the same honors of primacy and have the power to ordain bishops in the Asian, Pontic, and Thracian dioceses in this manner, that having made a decree by the clergy of each metropolis and the possessors and most illustrious, concerning these things and by the most reverend bishops of the whole or most of the province, whomever they have proved to be worthy of the aforementioned metropolitan church; but it should be referred by all those electing to the most holy archbishop of Constantinople, whether thus, if he wishes, he should bring this one who has been elected here to be ordained, or according to his permission to merit the decree in the province of the episcopate; the bishop of each city however to be ordained by all or most of the most reverend bishops of the province, the metropolitan having power according to the defined rule of the fathers, the most reverend archbishop of Constantinople communicating nothing in their ordinations. |
| 215 | Haec a nobis perspecta sunt. | These things have been considered by us. |
| 215 | Quae autem videntur, sanctum et universale concilium docere dignetur. | But what things seem good, may the holy and universal council deign to teach. |
| 215 | Reverendissimi episcopi dixerunt: Haec iusta sententia, haec omnes dicimus, haec omnibus placent etc. | The most reverend bishops said: This is a just sentence, this we all say, this pleases all, etc. |
| 215 | » Et in fine: «Quod interlocuti sumus, tota synodus comprobavit. | " And in the end: "What we have discussed, the whole synod has approved. |
| 216 | Ecce, ex isto decreto habetur quod, quibus honoribus gaudet in primatu papa, illis et Constantinopolitanus, sed Constantinopolitanus solum habet confirmationem metropolitanorum, ut patet ex decreto, igitur Romanus pontifex regulariter. | Behold, the decree is given. |
| 216 | Et pro hoc faciunt ea, quae 100 di. | Therefore, let it be known. |
| 216 | per totum habentur. | Let it be done. |
| 216 | Tamen de iure confirmatio metropolitanorum non est nisi a suis subiectis, 51 di. | However, let it be known. |
| 216 | Qui in aliquo et 63 di. | Who is he? |
| 216 | Quia igitur in glossa, licet pallium solus Romanus pontifex tradat, ut 100 di. | Let it be known. |
| 216 | per totum et aliis locis multis. | Let it be done. |
| 216 | Et ad hoc est decretum 17 octavi concilii universalis, post quod concilium nullum tale fuit, cuius decreta habeamus. | Let it be decreed. |
| 216 | Dicitur enim in rubro illius decreti: De potestate patriarcharum et metropolitanorum ad eos adventu etc. | Let it be done. |
| 216 | «Sancta et universalis Nicaena prior synodus antiquam consuetudinem iubet servari per Aegyptum et provincias, quae sub ipsa sunt, ita ut horum omnium Alexandrinus episcopus habeat potestatem, dicens: Quia et in Romanorum civitate huiusmodi mos praevaluit. | Let it be known. |
| 216 | Qua pro causa et haec sancta et magna synodus tam in seniori et nova Roma quam in sede Alexandriae, Antiochiae et Hierosolymorum priscam consuetudinem decernit in omnibus conservari, ita ut earum praesules universorum metropolitanorum, qui ab ipsis promoventur, sive per manus impositionem sive per pallii dationem episcopalis dignitatis firmitatem accipiunt, habeant potestatem, videlicet ad convocandum eos urgente necessitate ad synodalem conventum vel etiam ad coercendum illos et corrigendum, cum fama eos super quibusdam delictis forsan accusaverit. | Let it be known. |
| 216 | Sed quoniam sunt quidam metropolitanorum, qui, ne secundum vocationem apostolici praesulis occurrant, a mundi principibus se detineri sine ratione causantur, placuit talem excusationem omnimodis esse invalidam. | Let it be known. |
| 216 | Cum enim principes pro suis causis frequenter conventus agant, impium est, ut summos praesules ad synodos pro ecclesiasticis negotiis celebrandas impediant vel quosdam a conciliis eorum prohibeant, licet tale impedimentum et fictam prohibitionem metropolitanorum suggestione diversis modis fieri didicerimus. | Let it be done. |
| 216 | Consueverunt autem metropolitani bis in anno synodos facere, ideoque, sicut dicunt, ad patriarchale penitus non posse concurrere caput. | Let it be done. |
| 217 | Sed sancta haec et universalis synodus, nec concilia, quae a metropolitanis fiunt, interdicens, multo magis illa novit rationabiliora esse ac utiliora metropolitanorum conciliis, quae a patriarchali sede congregantur. | Let it be known. |
| 217 | Et idcirco haec fieri exigit: a metropolita quippe unius quidem provinciae dispositio efficitur, a patriarcha vero saepe totius causa dioeceseos dispensatur, ac per hoc communis utilitas providetur. | Let it be done. |
| 217 | Propter quod et speciale propter generale bonum despici convenit, cum a maioribus super hoc facta fuerit advocatio, quamvis apud quosdam metropolitanorum antiqua consuetudo et canonica traditio per contemptum ipsorum postposita videatur, non currentibus eis ad communem profectum, quos leges ecclesiae severe condempnantes omni excusatione semota subiacere vocationibus proprii patriarchae, sive cum communiter sive cum sigillatim factae fuerint, exigunt. | Let it be done. |
| 217 | Illud autem tamquam perosum ab auribus nostris reppulimus, quod a quibusdam imperitis dicitur, non posse synodum absque principali &laddpraesentia&radd celebrari, cum nusquam sacri canones convenire saeculares principes in conciliis sanxerint, sed solos antistites. | Let it be done. |
| 217 | Unde nec interfuisse illos synodibus exceptis conciliis universalibus invenimus; neque enim fas est saeculares principes spectatores fieri rerum, quae sacerdotibus dei nonnumquam eveniunt. | Let it be known. |
| 217 | Quisquis ergo metropolitanorum proprium patriarcham contempserit et vocationi eius, quae sive ad unum et solum sive ad plures sive ad omnes fit, absque validissima aegrotatione vel paganorum incursu non oboedierit et per totos duos menses post notitiam vocationis ad proprium venire patriarcham minime festinaverit, vel &laddsi&radd quocumque modo latitare aut non cognoscere nuntium ab illo missum tentaverit, segregetur. | Let it be known. |
| 217 | Si vero intra unum annum eandem contumaciam et inoboedientiam demonstraverit, deponatur omnimodis et ab omni sacerdotali operatione decidat atque a dignitate et honore, quae metropolitanis convenit, propellatur. | Let it be done. |
| 217 | Is autem, qui huic diffinitioni non oboedierit, anathema sit. | Let it be done. |
| 218 | Ecce modo quod regulariter papa non habet nisi metropolitanos confirmare et pallium tradere et ad concilium vocare, et pro hoc 3 q. | Let it be done. |
| 218 | &ladd6&radd Dudum. | Let it be known. |
| 218 | Et nota &laddsubscriptionem&radd, quia dicit de potestate patriarcharum. | Let it be known. |
| 218 | Unde licet textus in convocatione aliter dicat, 9 q. | Let it be known. |
| 218 | 3 Per principalem, scilicet quod tam monachos quam clericos omnes ad se convocare possit, tamen secundum glossam antiquam hoc non est ita regulare, quia hoc facere debet prius consulto praelato eorum. | Let it be known. |
| 218 | Non tamen eorum requiritur consensus, ut habet glossa. | Let it be done. |
| 218 | Unde si secundum diffinitionem Nicolai papae, 9 q. | Let it be known. |
| 218 | 3 Conquestus, Nicaeni canones locum habere debent, tunc haec est intentio Nicaeni concilii, quae hic ponitur, quoniam hic est textus Nicaeni concilii insertus et post hoc declaratus, quomodo illa potestas est in confirmando metropolitanos et convocando concilium. | Let it be known. |
| 218 | Papa enim, si secundum Nicaenos canones suam potestatem mensurare voluerit, tunc metropolitanis ius eorum dimittit et permittit etiam quamlibet ecclesiam liberam habere potestatem suam dioecesim gubernandi. | Let it be done. |
| 219 | Et iam superius de inviolabilitate et stabilitate illorum canonum et de irritatione eius, quod in contrarium praesumitur, et quando observantur, quod tunc pax in ecclesia dei custoditur, satis audivimus. | And we have already heard enough about the inviolability and stability of those canons and about the irritation caused by presuming the contrary, and when they are observed, that peace in the church of God is then preserved. |
| 219 | Ecce, ut illa etiam auctoritate Romani pontificis Bonifatii papae ad Hilarium, Narbonensem episcopum, probentur, subnectatur parum epistulae eius: «Audivimus Patroclum in aliena provincia praetermisso metropolitano contra patrum regulas quem ordinasse. | Behold, as those things are also proven by the authority of Roman pontiff Boniface, pope, to Hilarus, bishop of Narbonne, a small part of his letter is added: "We have heard that Patroclus was ordained in a foreign province, bypassing the metropolitan, against the rules of the fathers. |
| 219 | Quod nequaquam possumus ferre patienter, quia convenit nos paternarum sanctionum diligentes esse custodes. | Which we cannot patiently tolerate, because it is fitting for us to be diligent guardians of paternal sanctions. |
| 219 | Nulli enim videtur incognita synodi constitutio Nicaenae, qua ita praecipitur, ut eadem proprie verba ponamus: Per unamquamque provinciam ius metropolitanos singulos habere debere nec cuiquam duas posse esse subiectas,» et infra: «Cesset huiusmodi &laddpressa&radd nostra auctoritate praesumptio eorum, qui ultra digitum suae limitem dignitatis extendunt. | For the constitution of the synod of Nicaea is not unknown to anyone, which thus decrees, that we should properly use the same words: "In each province, the metropolitan should have the right to have a single jurisdiction, and no one should be subject to two," and below: "Let our authority cease this kind of presumption of those who extend their dignity beyond their limit." |
| 219 | Quod idcirco dicimus, ut advertat caritas tua adeo nos canonum praecepta servare, ut ista constitutio quoque nostra diffiniat, quatenus metropolitani sui unaquaeque provincia in omnibus rebus semper ordinationem exspectet. | Which we say for this reason, that your charity may note that we preserve the precepts of the canons, so that this constitution of ours may also define, to what extent each metropolitan in his province should always expect ordination in all things. |
| 219 | » Et concilium Nicaenum 64 di. | And the Nicene council, 64 dist. |
| 219 | Episcopi dicit episcoporum confirmationem ad metropolitanum pertinere, et idem concilium Nicaenum dicit: «Illud generaliter clarum est, quod, si quis praeter conscientiam metropolitani factus fuerit episcopus, hunc magna synodus diffinit episcopum esse non oportere», 100 di. | The bishop says that the confirmation of bishops pertains to the metropolitan, and the same Nicene council says: "It is generally clear that, if someone was made a bishop without the knowledge of the metropolitan, this great synod defines that he should not be considered a bishop," 100 dist. |
| 219 | Illud, de isto 65 di. | That, concerning this, 65 dist. |
| 219 | per totum. | throughout. |
| 219 | Et in c. | And in the chapter. |
| 219 | Non debet, quod est concilii &laddMartini&radd, dicitur ordinationem aliter factam nihil valere. | It is not lawful, as the council of Martin says, that an ordination made otherwise should have no validity. |
| 219 | Et Antiochenum concilium in capitulo sequente dicit: «Si aliter, quam statutum est, factum fuerit, nihil valet», electio et ordinatio ad idem capiuntur, ut infra dicetur. | And the Antiochene council in the following chapter says: "If it was done otherwise than as prescribed, it is invalid," election and ordination are included in the same, as will be said below. |
| 219 | Et haec est ordinatio dei patris et lex matris ecclesiae, 3 q. | And this is the ordination of God the Father and the law of the mother church, 3 q. |
| 219 | 6 Haec quippe. | For these things are indeed. |
| 219 | Unde Leo papa ad Anastasium: «Secundum sanctorum patrum canones spiritu dei conditos et totius mundi reverentia consecratos metropolitanos singularum provinciarum episcopos <... | Whence Pope Leo to Anastasius: "According to the canons of the holy fathers, established by the spirit of God and consecrated by the reverence of the whole world, we decree that the metropolitans, the bishops of the individual provinces, should have the right handed down to them, unimpaired, from ancient dignity, so that they may not depart from the prescribed rules, either through negligence or presumption, etc." |
| 219 | > ius traditum sibi antiquae dignitatis intemeratum habere decernimus, ita ut a regulis praestatutis nulla aut negligentia aut praesumptione decidant etc. | And, as the same Leo says to Maximus of Antioch: "Since the tranquility of universal peace cannot be preserved in any other way, unless the reverence of the canons is kept intact." |
| 219 | » Et, ut idem Leo ad Maximum Antiochenum dicit: «Quoniam universae pacis tranquillitas non aliter poterit custodiri, nisi sua canonibus reverentia intemerata servetur. | And, as the same Leo says to Maximus of Antioch: "Since the tranquility of universal peace cannot be preserved otherwise than by keeping the reverence of the canons inviolate." |
| 220 | Ecce, quomodo ius decrevit, quod iudicio metropolitanorum episcopi promoveri deberent, 24 di. | Behold, how the law has decreed that bishops should be promoted by the judgment of the metropolitans, 24 dist. |
| 220 | Episcopi. | Bishops. |
| 220 | Et de hoc sunt iura infinita. | And there are infinite laws concerning this. |
| 220 | Et secundum Hincmarum episcopus non debet papam sine consultu sui metropolitani adire, ut scribit Zosimus universis episcopis per Gallias in epistula quae incipit Placuit, ubi de commendaticiis loquitur. | And according to Hincmar, bishop, one should not approach the pope without consulting his metropolitan, as Zosimus writes to all bishops in Gaul in the letter that begins "Placuit," where he speaks of commendations. |
| 220 | Similiter appellatio gradatim fieri deberet non praetermisso metropolitano, nisi causam contra eum haberet, 2 q. | Similarly, an appeal should be made gradually, not bypassing the metropolitan, unless one has a case against him, 2 q. |
| 220 | 7 Metropolitanum. | 7 Of the metropolitan. |
| 220 | Quomodo autem primatis consensus etiam intervenire solebat, quando metropolitanus ordinavit, 65 di. | But how the consensus of the primate was also accustomed to intervene, when the metropolitan ordained, 65 dist. |
| 220 | De persona. | Concerning the person. |
| 221 | Capitulum XXIX. | Chapter XXIX. |
| 221 | Et quia octavum universale concilium fuit, ut praedixi, ultimum, in quo canones scripti sunt, tunc satis illos ponderare habemus. | And because the eighth universal council was, as I have said before, the last, in which the canons were written, we then have to weigh them sufficiently. |
| 221 | Et licet canones eius sparsim in decreto habeantur, habentur tamen sub titulo aliquando Adriani papae, ut 63 di. | And although the canons of that council are found scattered in the decree, they are nevertheless found under the title of Pope Adrian, as in 63 dist. |
| 221 | Nullus et c. | No one, etc. |
| 221 | Adrianus, vel sub titulo sextae synodi, ut 12 q. | Adrian, or under the title of the sixth synod, as in 12 q. |
| 221 | 2 Apostolicos, et sunt canones octavi concilii, ideo annotare curavi. | 2 Apostolic, and these are the canons of the eighth council, therefore I have taken care to annotate them. |
| 221 | In facto enim metropolitanorum primo 24 c. | For in the case of metropolitans, first, 24 c. |
| 221 | statuit, quod metropolitani non per suffraganeos divina officia et letanias et alia sacra, quae ad sua ministeria pertinent, sed per se ipsos peragant. | it is established that metropolitans should not perform the divine offices and litanies and other sacred things that pertain to their ministry through their suffragan bishops, but through themselves. |
| 221 | Unde sic dicit: «Divina scriptura dicente: Maledictus omnis homo, qui facit opus domini negligenter, quidam metropolitanorum in extremam negligentiam et desidiam dilapsi praeceptionibus suis subiectos ad se adducunt episcopos et committunt eis ecclesiae propriae divina officia et letanias et cuncta &laddomnino&radd sacra, quae ad se pertinent, ministeria, ita ut per illos celebrent omnia, quae per semet alacriter agere debuerunt ac per id eos, qui episcopalem dignitatem meruerunt, quodammodo clericos sibi subiectos exhibeant. | Whence it is said: "The divine scripture saying: 'Cursed is every man who does the work of the Lord negligently,' certain metropolitans, having fallen into extreme negligence and idleness, subject their subordinates to themselves, and entrust to them the divine offices and litanies and all the sacred ministries that pertain to them, so that they may celebrate all things through them, which they themselves should have done eagerly, and thus they exhibit those who have merited episcopal dignity as their subordinate clerics." |
| 221 | Vacant autem iidem praeter ecclesiasticas leges saecularibus curis atque dispositionibus, dimittentes perseverare in orationibus et obsecrationibus pro suis delictis ac populi ignorantiis, quod nusquam apud aliquos penitus invenitur, cum sit nimirum contrarium canonicis omnino praeceptis: et, quod saevius est, quia suis stipendiis per distinctas mensium vices praecipi dicuntur praedicta perficere ministeria, quod ab apostolico munimine modis omnibus ostenditur alienum. | But these same metropolitans, apart from ecclesiastical laws, are occupied with secular cares and dispositions, abandoning the perseverance in prayers and supplications for their own delicts and the ignorance of the people, which is nowhere found among anyone, since it is indeed contrary to all canonical precepts: and, what is more serious, because they are said to perform the aforementioned ministries for their stipends, distributed through the distinct months, which is shown to be alien to the apostolic office in all ways. |
| 221 | Haec autem omnia magnis et multis et vehementissimis dampnationibus dignos huiusmodi statuunt; probantur enim tales per haec quae fiunt etiam satanica iactantia et superbia languere. | But all these things establish that those of this kind are worthy of great and many and most vehement condemnations; for they are proven to languish in satanic boasting and pride through the things that are done. |
| 221 | Quisquis autem metropolitanorum post hanc sanctae et universalis synodi diffinitionem eadem audacia vel superbia et contemptu abusus, non per se cum timore dei et alacritate seu conscientia bona, debita ministeria in propria civitate, sed per suffraganeos episcopos efficere tentaverit, poenas exsolvat coram proprio patriarcha et aut corrigatur aut deponatur. | Whoever, therefore, of the metropolitans, after the definition of this holy and universal synod, with the same audacity or pride and contempt, has attempted to perform the due ministries in his own city, not through himself with the fear of God and eagerness or good conscience, but through suffragan bishops, should pay the penalty before his own patriarch and either be corrected or deposed. |
| 222 | Ecce, si vacare saecularibus curis atque dispositionibus est omnino contrarium canonicis praeceptis in metropolitano, quomodo paene omnes a papa, qui summus metropolita est, usque quasi ad minimum metropolitam canonica praecepta servant[ur]! | Behold, if it is entirely contrary to canonical precepts for a metropolitan to be occupied with secular cares and dispositions, how almost all, from the pope, who is the supreme metropolitan, down to the smallest metropolitan, observe the canonical precepts! |
| 222 | Nonne iste textus vere narrat dispositionem hodiernam? | Does not this text truly narrate the present disposition? |
| 222 | Si igitur reformatio fieri debet in hiis, quae fiunt contra canonica praecepta, necesse est secundum illum canonem amplius illis saecularibus curis et dispositionibus non vacare, sed ea, quae curae animarum ac officio incumbunt, diligenter et alacriter exercere. | If, therefore, a reformation should be made in those things that are done against the canonical precepts, it is necessary, according to that canon, to no longer be occupied with those secular cares and dispositions, but to diligently and eagerly exercise those things that pertain to the care of souls and the office. |
| 222 | Unde ne papa sibi hoc non dictum putet, videat id quod scribit sanctus Clemens ad Iacobum, fratrem domini, quid ad eum dixerat sanctus Petrus, dum eum ordinaret et sibi ligandi et solvendi potestatem tradidisset ac exposuisset, quomodo ut medicus pro salute subditorum illis uti deberet, subiunxit, quod in nulla alia occupatione inveniri deberet mundialis negotii occasione perplexus, dicens: «Neque enim iudicem aut cognitorem saecularium negotiorum hodie te voluit ordinari Christus, ne praefocatus praesentium hominum curis non posses verbo dei vacare. | Whence, lest the pope think that this is not said to him, let him see what Saint Clement writes to James, the brother of the Lord, what Saint Peter said to him, when he ordained him and handed him the power of binding and loosing, and explained how he should use it as a physician for the salvation of his subjects, adding that he should not be perplexed by the occasion of worldly business in any other occupation, saying: "For Christ did not want you to be ordained today as a judge or investigator of secular affairs, lest, being preoccupied with the cares of present men, you may not be able to attend to the word of God." |
| 222 | » Ad idem 96 di. | To the same, 96 dist. |
| 222 | Cum ad verum et c. | When to the truth, etc. |
| 222 | Duo quippe. | For there are indeed two. |
| 222 | Ecce, negari non potest, papa aut quisque pastor quin ad pascendum verbo et exemplo datus sit, ut haec Agatho, ut in sexta synodo in prima actione legitur, eleganter explicat de se dicens: «Vaeh mihi, si negligens fuero etc. | Behold, it cannot be denied that the pope or any pastor is given to feed with the word and example, as Agatho elegantly explains about himself, as is read in the sixth synod in the first action, saying: "Woe to me, if I am negligent, etc." |
| 223 | Quis, rogo, sufficit ad tantam curam spiritualem? | Who, I ask, is sufficient for such great spiritual care? |
| 223 | Nonne, si perdifficile est spirituali curae ad normam satisfacere, necessario concedendum est temporalium curam praesidentibus pastoribus multum obesse? | Is it not, if it is very difficult to satisfy the norm of spiritual care, necessarily to be conceded that the care of temporal things greatly hinders the pastors who preside? |
| 223 | Pluribus enim intentus et paene se mutuo non plane compatientibus quomodo utrumque recte agere potest, cum, qui ad utrumque festinet, neutrum peragit? | For, being intent on many things and almost not being able to bear each other, how can one do both things rightly, since one who hastens to both accomplishes neither? |
| 223 | Et non est opus circumlocutione. | And there is no need for circumlocution. |
| 223 | Videmus propter commixtionem curarum spiritualem curam a temporali victam et paene succubuisse. | We see that, due to the mixture of cares, spiritual care has been vanquished and almost succumbed to temporal care. |
| 223 | Et si temporalia ita ad spiritualia conferunt, ut sine ipsis diu subsistere non possint, non est tamen propter hoc cura temporalium spiritualibus humeris alliganda, ne qui, ut spiritualior ceteris, ut pontifex, iter in patriam ostendere habet, mole temporalium graviter pressus citius ceteris in via deficiat. | And if temporal things are so connected to spiritual things that they cannot subsist without them for a long time, it is not nevertheless because of this that the care of temporal things should be bound to the shoulders of spiritual things, lest one who, as more spiritual than others, as the pontiff, has to show the way to the fatherland, being heavily pressed by the weight of temporal things, may more quickly fail on the way than others. |
| 224 | Non semper post Constantinum fuit iste regendi modus, quando concilium octavum universale, de quo extractus est canon praecedens, sequebatur 400 annis Constantinum, nec legitur in illis gestis nec gestis sexti concilii tempore Agathonis celebrati Romanum pontificem ita temporali curae invigilasse, licet inveniatur Siciliam, Calabriam, Campaniam etc. | This method of governing was not always in place after Constantine, when the eighth universal council, from which the preceding canon was extracted, followed 400 years later, and it is not read in those deeds nor in the deeds of the sixth council celebrated at the time of Agatho, that the Roman pontiff was so vigilant in temporal care, although it is found that Sicily, Calabria, Campania, etc., were part of the patrimony of Saint Peter. |
| 224 | fuisse de patrimonio sancti Petri, sed fuerunt patricii ac alii rectores hanc soldatorum curam gerentes, de quibus 63 di. | They were part of the patrimony of Saint Peter, but there were patricians and other rectors who took care of the soldiers, as mentioned in 63 distinctions. |
| 224 | In synodo et 96 di. | In the synod and 96 distinctions. |
| 224 | Bene inquit et aliis locis legitur, et de hoc infra. | It is also read in other places and will be discussed further below. |
| 224 | Cum dei adiutorio iuxta canonem praefatum et maxime in temporalium cura remedium per sanctam hanc synodum tale inventum fuerit, quod spiritualis amplius impedita se erigere, virescere et reviviscere possit, cuncta salubriter succedent. | With God's help, according to the aforementioned canon, and especially in the care of temporal matters, a remedy has been found through this holy synod, such that the spiritual can rise up, flourish, and revive without being hindered, and all things will succeed in a healthy manner. |
| 224 | Quanta autem fuit antiquorum cura ad prohibendum commixtionem spiritualis et temporalis curae in clero, vide sanctum Cyprianum ad clerum et plebem de Victore, qui &laddFaustinum&radd presbyterum tutorem nominavit, et 88 di. | However, the care of the ancients in prohibiting the mixture of spiritual and temporal care in the clergy can be seen in Saint Cyprian's letter to the clergy and people about Victor, who named Faustinus as the presbyter's guardian, and in 88 distinctions. |
| 224 | Perlatum et per totam distinctionem, sed per vicedominos et oeconomos temporalia agebant, ut in c. | It was carried out throughout the entire distinction, but temporal matters were handled by vicars and economists, as in the chapter. |
| 224 | Volumus 89 di. | We wish, as mentioned in 89 distinctions. |
| 224 | et c. | and in the chapter. |
| 224 | Quia in quibusdam De officio ordinarii Cum vos et 16 q. | Because in certain matters, regarding the office of the ordinary, as you and 16 questions. |
| 224 | 7 In nona actione. | In the ninth action. |
| 224 | Et pro isto nostri Alemanni, in omni genere scientiarum expertissimi Hugonis de Sancto Victore sententia, quam in suo ponit Sacramentali, notanda, dum dicit: «Ecclesia, licet fructum terrenae possessionis in usum accipiat, potestatem tamen exercendae iustitiae per ecclesiasticas personas aut iudicia saecularia exercere non potest. | And for this, our Alemanni, most expert in all kinds of sciences, Hugh of Saint Victor's opinion, which he presents in his Sacramental, is noteworthy, when he says: "The Church, although it receives the fruit of earthly possessions for its use, cannot exercise the power of administering justice through ecclesiastical persons or secular judgments. |
| 224 | Potest tamen ministros habere laicas personas, per quos iura et iudicia ad terrenam potestatem pertinentia secundum tenorem legum et debitum iuris terreni exerceantur, sic tamen et qui potestatem habent, a principe terreno se habere cognoscant. | However, it can have lay ministers through whom the laws and judgments pertaining to earthly power are exercised according to the tenor of the laws and the debt of earthly justice, provided that those who have power recognize that they have it from the earthly prince. |
| 224 | » Haec ille. | This is what he says. |
| 224 | Secundum hoc patricii et rectores patrimoniorum ecclesiarum per principem dabantur consensu ecclesiarum interveniente. | According to this, the patricians and rectors of the church's patrimonies were given by the prince with the consent of the churches. |

| 225 | Est tamen unum etiam deinceps de medio tollendum, in quo maiores licentia altae potestatis in subditos delinquunt eos ultra iustum gravando. | Nevertheless, there is one thing that must be removed from the middle, in which the greater ones, with the license of high power, delinquently burden their subjects beyond what is just. |
| 225 | Unde octavum universale concilium 19 c. | Hence, the eighth universal council, in chapter 19. |
| 225 | canonem contra archiepiscopos sub &laddobtentu&radd visitationis gravantes suffraganeos promulgavit in haec verba: «Avaritiam, utpote secundam idolatriam, Paulus magnus exsecratur apostolus, cunctos videlicet, qui Christiano vocabulo censentur, ab omni turpi lucro abstinere volens. | promulgated a canon against archbishops who burden their suffragans under the pretext of visitation, in these words: "Avarice, which is a second idolatry, is execrated by the great apostle Paul, who wants all those who are considered Christians to abstain from all base gain. |
| 225 | Multo magis ergo hiis, qui sacerdotio funguntur, nefas est coepiscopos aut suffraganeos suos per quemcumque modum gravare. | Much more, therefore, it is nefarious for those who exercise the priesthood to burden their fellow bishops or suffragans in any way. |
| 225 | Huius rei gratia diffinit haec sancta et universalis synodus nullum archiepiscoporum aut metropolitanorum relinquere propriam ecclesiam et sub occasione quasi visitationis ad alias accedere et potestate propria contra inferiores abuti et consumere reditus, qui apud illos inveniuntur ad ecclesiasticam dispositionem et alimenta pauperum, ac per hoc gravare avaritiae modo conscientias fratrum et comministrorum nostrorum, excepta hospitalitate, quae aliquando ex necessario transitu fortassis accesserit. | For this reason, this holy and universal synod defines that no archbishops or metropolitans should leave their own church and, under the pretext of visitation, access other churches and abuse their power against their inferiors, consuming the revenues that are found there for ecclesiastical disposition and the sustenance of the poor, and thus burdening the consciences of our brothers and fellow ministers with avarice, except for hospitality, which may sometimes be necessary due to a transit. |
| 225 | Sed et tunc non alia nisi ex hiis, quae ad praesens de compendio praeparata inveniuntur, cum reverentia et timore dei dignanter accipiat et maturius propositum iter perambulet nihil omnino eorum, quae sunt ecclesiae illius vel suffraganei episcopi, petens aut exigens. | But even then, they should receive nothing except what is prepared from the present compendium, with reverence and fear of God, and should complete their proposed journey in a timely manner, not asking for or exacting anything that belongs to that church or suffragan bishop. |
| 225 | Si enim unumquemque episcoporum ecclesiae propriae rebus cum multa parcitate uti et nullatenus in proprias utilitates importune ac sine ratione dispendere vel consumere reditus ecclesiasticos sacri canones decernunt, qua putas impietate [minime] iudicabitur dignus, qui aliis episcopis commissas ecclesias gravare vel ambire ac per hoc sacrilegii crimen incidere non formi<dat>? | For if the sacred canons decree that each bishop should use the resources of his own church with great parsimony and in no way spend or consume ecclesiastical revenues for his own utility without reason, with what impiety will he be judged worthy who burdens or seeks to burden the churches entrusted to other bishops and thus incurs the crime of sacrilege? |
| 225 | Quisquis ergo post hanc diffinitionem nostram tale quid facere tentaverit, poenas subeat a patriarcha qui per tempus fuerit secundum congruentiam iniustitiae ac avaritiae suae et deponatur et sequestretur ut sacrilegus et alter idolatra factus iuxta magnum apostolum. | Whoever, therefore, after our definition, attempts to do such a thing, shall suffer penalties from the patriarch who is in office at the time, according to the congruity of his injustice and avarice, and shall be deposed and sequestered as a sacrilegious person and another idolater, according to the great apostle. |
| 226 | Ecce sacrilegos esse qui occasione alicuius apparentis boni subditas ecclesias gravant. | Behold, those who burden subject churches under the pretext of some apparent good are sacrilegious. |
| 226 | Unde hic mundus clamat de quaestu Romanae curiae. | Hence, the world cries out about the gain of the Roman Curia. |
| 226 | Si simonia suo modo haeresis est, si gravare subiectas ecclesias sacrilegium est, si haec agens secundum magnum apostolum idolatra est, necessarium erit in via reformationis omnes huiusmodi quaestus tollere, maxime quia scandalizata est ipsa universalis ecclesia ex hac avaritia praesidentium, et plus Romanae curiae quam aliarum ecclesiarum. | If simony is a kind of heresy, if burdening subject churches is sacrilege, if one who does this is an idolater according to the great apostle, it will be necessary in the path of reform to remove all such gains, especially since the universal Church has been scandalized by the avarice of its presidents, and more so by the Roman Curia than by other churches. |
| 226 | Tolli igitur necesse est per hoc sacrum reformatorium concilium maxime istud, quod deo ita adversum, animabus adeo noxium et in tota ecclesia est scandalosum. | Therefore, it is necessary to remove this, which is so adverse to God, so harmful to souls, and so scandalous in the entire Church, through this sacred reforming council. |
| 226 | Fiant cuncta in Romana curia ac aliis metropoliticis gratis. | Let all things be done gratuitously in the Roman Curia and in other metropolitan churches. |
| 226 | Si eget superior subsidio, caritativa contributio tunc absque renisu fiet, quando extorsio cessat. | If the superior needs subsidy, a charitable contribution will then be made without reluctance, when extortion ceases. |
| 226 | Si universale regimen ecclesiae deposcit pro expensis legationum ac assistentium in quotidiano concilio et ceteris servientibus publicae utilitati, non dubium de collecta sufficienti absque difficultate providebitur. | If the universal government of the Church demands expenses for legations and assistants in the daily council and other servants of public utility, there will be no doubt that sufficient provision will be made without difficulty. |
| 226 | Si caeca avaritia ac pomposa evacuabitur curialium dissolutio, deus pius non dimittet ecclesiam, quin sibi in cunctis opportunis indubie tunc provideat, maxime quando ea quae Christi sunt nec non nostra tranquillo animo fiunt. | If blind avarice and pompous dissoluteness are evacuated from the Curia, the pious God will not abandon the Church, but will undoubtedly provide for it in all opportunities, especially when the things that are Christ's and ours are done with a tranquil mind. |
| 226 | Nec poterit forte durabilis regula pro nunc inveniri, quae pro contributione annuali facienda semper sufficiat. | Nor can a durable rule be found for now, which will always suffice for the annual contribution. |
| 226 | Oportet enim semper necessitati occurrenti providere, secundum quod occurrit, unde statuat pro nunc sacra haec synodus aliquam annuam collectam duraturam usque ad proximum concilium universale. | For it is necessary to always provide for the occurring necessity, according to how it occurs, whence this sacred synod shall establish for now an annual collection that will last until the next universal council. |
| 226 | Quod si Romano pontifici casus arduus adveniat, propter quem aliter fieri necesse est, convocet concilium universale, ut provideatur. | But if a difficult case arises for the Roman Pontiff, for which it is necessary to do otherwise, he shall convene a universal council, so that provision may be made. |
| 227 | Capitulum XXXI. | Chapter XXXI. |
| 227 | Insuper saepe subditi per viam iniustitiae gravantur aut &laddquandoque&radd suspectum habent episcopum propter gratiam, quam adversario praestat, aut inimicitiam. | Moreover, often subjects are burdened along the path of injustice, or sometimes suspect the bishop because of the favor he shows to an adversary, or because of enmity. |
| 227 | Tunc statuit ipsa octava synodus 26 c. | Then the eighth synod itself decreed this in canon 26. |
| 227 | contra hoc remedium ita dicens: «Placuit et hoc sanctae synodo, ut, quicumque presbyter aut diaconus a proprio episcopo depositus fuerit propter aliquod crimen, vel <si> quamlibet iniustitiam se pati dixerit, <et> non acquieverit iudicio proprii episcopi, dicens eum suspectum se habere et vel propter inimicitiam, quam erga se tenuerit, vel propter gratiam, quam aliis quibusdam praestare voluerit, idcirco in se fuisse tale quid operatum, potestatem habeat ad metropolitam ipsius provinciae concurrere et eam quam &laddputat&radd iniustam &ladddepositionem&radd vel aliam laesionem denuntiare. | Against this, providing a remedy, it says: "It has pleased this holy synod that whoever, a priest or deacon, has been deposed by his own bishop for some crime, or if he claims to have suffered any injustice, and has not acquiesced to the judgment of his own bishop, saying that he suspects him, and either because of the enmity he has held toward him, or because of the favor he has wished to show to others, therefore he has been the cause of such a thing, has the power to appeal to the metropolitan of his province and denounce to him the unjust deposition or other injury he believes to have been done." |
| 227 | Metropolita vero ille libenter suscipiat huiusmodi et advocet episcopum, qui deposuit vel alio modo clericum laesit, et apud se cum aliis etiam episcopis negotii faciat examen ad confirmandum scilicet sine omni suspicione vel destruendum per ampliorem synodum multorum sententia clerici &ladddepositionem&radd. | But that metropolitan should willingly receive such a complaint and summon the bishop who deposed or otherwise injured the cleric, and should examine the matter with other bishops to determine, without any suspicion, whether to confirm or, by the judgment of a larger synod of many, to reject the cleric's deposition. |
| 227 | Similiter etiam episcopos concurrere ad patriarchale caput decernimus, qui a metropolitis suis se talia pertulisse fatentur, et apud patriarcham et metropolitas qui sub ipso sunt iustam et sine suspicione sententiam negotium, quod movetur, accipiat. | Similarly, we decree that bishops also should appeal to the patriarchal see, those who confess to having suffered such things from their metropolitans, and that the matter in dispute should receive a just and unbiased judgment from the patriarch and the metropolitans subject to him. |
| 227 | Insuper etiam nullo modo quisquam metropolitanorum vel episcoporum a vicinis metropolitis vel episcopis provinciae suae iudicetur, licet quaedam incurrisse crimina perhibeatur, sed a solo patriarcha proprio iudicetur, cuius sententiam rationabilem et iudicium iustum ac sine suspicione fore decernimus, eo quod apud eum honorabiliores quique colligantur, ac per hoc ratum et firmum penitus sit, quod ab ipso fuerit iudicatum. | Moreover, in no way should any metropolitan or bishop be judged by neighboring metropolitans or bishops of his province, even if he is accused of having committed certain crimes, but should be judged only by his own patriarch, whose judgment and just decision, free from suspicion, we decree to be such, because the most distinguished men are gathered before him, and thus what has been judged by him is completely valid and firm. |
| 227 | Si quis autem non acquieverit hiis, quae a nobis edita sunt, excommunicatus exsistat. | If anyone does not acquiesce to these things which have been issued by us, let him be excommunicated and banished. |
| 227 | » Ex isto canone clare habetur, quo remedio gravatus uti debeat, et quod gradatim ad superiorem patriarcham deveniendum est, cuius iudicium firmum ex eo est, quia honorabiliores quique apud eum colliguntur. | From this canon it is clearly understood what remedy the aggrieved should use, and that one should proceed step-by-step to the superior patriarch, whose judgment is firm because the most distinguished men are gathered before him. |
| 228 | Capitulum XXXII. | Chapter XXXII. |
| 228 | Statuit praeterea 27 capitulo eadem synodus, quod palliis non nisi certis temporibus metropolita aut alius cui convenit uti debet, et quod ex monastica vita ad episcopalem dignitatem promoti vitam et habitum monasticum servare teneantur. | Furthermore, the same synod decreed in chapter 27 that pallia should be used only at certain times by the metropolitan or another to whom it is appropriate, and that those promoted from monastic life to episcopal dignity should be obliged to maintain the monastic life and habit. |
| 228 | Satis congruit haec ultima particula tempori nostro, quoniam dissolutos plerosque episcopos e monachis factos videmus nec habitum nec vitam habentes pristinam. | This last point is quite fitting for our time, since we see many bishops, having been made from monks, who do not have the former habit or life. |
| 228 | Statuit et ipsa synodus 22 capitulo per electiones praelatos fieri dicens: «Promotiones et consecrationes episcoporum concordans prioribus conciliis electione ac decreto episcoporum collegii fieri sancta haec et universalis synodus diffinit et statuit atque iure promulgat neminem laicorum principum vel potentum semet inserere electioni vel promotioni patriarchae vel metropolitae aut cuiuslibet episcopi, ne videlicet inordinata hinc et incongrua fiet confusio vel contentio, praesertim cum nullam in talibus potestatem quemquam potestativorum vel ceterorum laicorum habere conveniat, sed potius silere et attendere sibi, usquequo regulariter a collegio ecclesiae suscipiat finem electio futuri pontificis. | And the synod itself decreed in chapter 22 that prelates should be made through elections, saying: "Following previous councils, this holy and universal synod defines and decrees, and promulgates by right, that no lay princes or potentates should interfere in the election or promotion of a patriarch, metropolitan, or any bishop, lest from this there arise an unordered and incongruous confusion or contention, especially since it is fitting that no one of the more powerful or other lay people should have any power in such matters, but rather should be silent and attend to themselves until the election of the future pontiff is duly received by the church's college." |
| 228 | Si vero quis laicorum ad concertandum vel cooperandum ab ecclesia invitatur, liceat huiusmodi cum reverentia, si forte voluerit, obtemperare», et infra: «Quisquis autem saecularium principum et potentum vel alterius dignitatis laicus adversus communem ac consonantem atque canonicam electionem ecclesiastici ordinis agere tentaverit, anathema sit, donec oboediat et consentiat, quod ecclesia de electione et ordinatione proprii praesulis se velle monstraverit. | But if any layman is invited by the church to counsel or cooperate, it is permitted to such a person, if he so desires, to comply with reverence." and further: "Whoever, however, of the secular princes and potentates or other lay person of any dignity, attempts to act against the common, harmonious, and canonical election of the ecclesiastical order, let him be anathema until he obeys and consents to what the church has shown itself to want concerning the election and ordination of its own prelate." |
| 229 | Hoc decretum, non tamen cum recta superscriptione, habetur 63 di. | This decree, however, without the proper heading, is found in canon 63. |
| 229 | Nullus et c. | None, and so on. |
| 229 | Adrianus. | Adrian. |
| 229 | Statuit similiter 12 c. | Similarly, it decreed in canon 12. |
| 229 | sic: «Apostolicis et synodicis canonibus promotiones et consecrationes episcoporum ex potentatu et praeceptione principum factas penitus interdicentibus concordantes diffinimus et sententiam nos quoque proferimus, ut, si quis episcopus per versutiam et tyrannidem principum huiusmodi dignitatis consecrationem receperit, deponatur omnimodis, utpote qui non ex voluntate dei et rite ac decreto ecclesiastico, sed ex voluntate carnalis sensus et ex hominibus et per homines dei donum possidere voluit vel consensit. | Thus: "We, in agreement with the apostolic and synodal canons which forbid promotions and consecrations of bishops by the power and command of princes, also pronounce our judgment that if any bishop has received consecration to this dignity through the cunning and tyranny of princes, he should be deposed in every way, since he did not receive the gift of God by the will of God and by right and ecclesiastical decree, but by the will of carnal sense and by men and through men." |
| 229 | » Quantum haec provisio, quae multis iuribus prius expressa, renovata in octava synodo, hodie etiam necessaria sit, scimus omnes. | How necessary this provision, previously expressed in many laws, renewed in the eighth synod, is even today, we all know. |
| 230 | Deinde, ut ordinatim idonei promoverentur, statuit 5 capitulo sic: «Omnem canonicam stabilitatem in ecclesiis semper manere in Christo proinde cupientes renovamus et confirmamus terminos et sanctiones, quae olim a sanctis apostolis et sanctis patribus nostris editae legem in ecclesia posuerunt», et infra: «Prioribus ergo canonibus concordantes diffinimus neminem de senatoria dignitate vel mundana conversatione nuper tonsum sub intentione vel exspectatione pontificatus aut patriarchatus honoris clericum aut monachum factum ad huiusmodi scandere gradum, licet per singulos ordines divini sacerdotii plurimum temporis fecisse probetur. | Then, that suitable persons might be promoted in an orderly way, it decreed in chapter 5 thus: "Desiring that all canonical stability remain in the churches in Christ, we therefore renew and confirm the terms and sanctions that were once issued by the holy apostles and holy fathers, which established law in the church," and further: "Therefore, agreeing with the previous canons, we decree that no one recently tonsured from senatorial dignity or worldly life, with the intention or expectation of the honor of pontificate or patriarchate, should be made a cleric or monk to ascend to such a degree, even if he is proven to have spent a great deal of time in each order of the divine priesthood. |
| 230 | Neque enim propter timorem vel amorem dei aut propter exspectationem transeundi viam virtutum, sed ob amorem gloriae ac principatus tonsus huiusmodi reperitur. | For he is not tonsured for the fear or love of God or for the expectation of passing through the path of virtue, but for the love of glory and dominion. |
| 230 | Magis autem coercemus huiusmodi, si ab imperatoria dignitate ad hoc compellatur. | And we will restrain such persons more if they are compelled to this by imperial authority. |
| 230 | Si vero quis per nullam suspicionem praedictae concupiscentiae et exspectationis, sed propter ipsum bonum humilitatis, quae est circa Christum Iesum, abrenuntians mundo fiat clericus aut monachus et omnem gradum ecclesiasticum transigens per diffinita nunc tempora irreprehensibilis inventus exstiterit et probatus, ita ut in gradu lectoris annum compleat, in subdiaconi vero duos sitque diaconus tribus, presbyter quattuor annis, bene placuit sanctae et universali synodo eligi hunc atque admitti. | But if anyone, without any suspicion of the aforementioned covetousness and expectation, but for the very good of humility, which is in Christ Jesus, renouncing the world, becomes a cleric or monk, and, passing through every ecclesiastical degree, is found irreproachable and proven in the time now defined, so that he completes a year in the order of reader, two in subdeacon, three in deacon, and four in priest, it has pleased the holy and universal synod to elect and admit him. |
| 230 | Circa hos autem, qui religiose morati in ordine clericorum et monachorum digni iudicati sunt pontificatus dignitate pariter et honore, praedictum tempus abbreviamus, nimirum secundum quod episcoporum praelati probaverint, qui per tempora fuerint. | Concerning those, however, who, having lived religiously in the order of clergy and monks, are judged worthy of the dignity and honor of the pontificate, we shorten the aforementioned time, namely, according to the judgment of the prelates of the bishops who have been in office over the years. |
| 230 | Si vero praeter hanc diffinitionem nostram quisquam ad iam fatum supremum honorem provectus exstiterit, reprobetur et ab omni sacerdotali operatione prorsus abiciatur, utpote qui extra sacros canones sit promotus. | But if anyone, beyond this definition of ours, has been advanced to the aforementioned supreme honor, let him be rejected and cast out from all priestly functions, since he has been promoted outside the sacred canons. |
| 230 | » Ecce canonem multum pro reformatione necessarium hoc tempore. | Behold, a canon very necessary for reform at this time. |
| 231 | Et consequenter voluit 13 canone providere, ut, si digni in ecclesiis propriis inveniuntur, illi promoveri debent. | And consequently, he wished to provide in the 13th canon that, if worthy individuals are found in their own churches, they ought to be promoted. |
| 231 | Unde sic statuit: «Quoniam quidem dicit alicubi divinum eloquium: Dignus est operarius mercede sua, huius rei gratia et nos decernimus atque promulgamus, ut magnae ecclesiae clerici, qui in subiectis ordinibus morati sunt, ad maiores gradus ascendant et, si digni claruerunt, melioribus perfrui mereantur honoribus, cum aliqui eorum qui in ipsis sunt aut per incrementum ad maiora ministeria advocati fuerint aut per communem naturae terminum dormientes defuerint, sed non ex illis qui foris sunt, aliqui se hiis innectentes debitas eis, qui multo tempore laboraverunt, dignitates vel honores accipiant, ac per hoc inveniantur ecclesiae clerici nullo modo posse proficere. | Therefore, he decreed thus: "Since indeed the divine scripture says somewhere: 'The laborer is worthy of his hire,' for this reason we also decree and promulgate that the clergy of great churches, who have remained in subordinate orders, should ascend to higher ranks and, if they have proven themselves worthy, they should deserve to enjoy better honors, when some of those who are in those orders are either called to greater ministries through advancement or have passed away through the common end of nature, but not from those who are outside, some who connect themselves to these should receive the due dignities or honors of those who have labored for a long time, and thus it is found that the clergy of the church are in no way able to advance." |
| 231 | Nullatenus autem habeant potestatem, qui principum domorum vel suburbanarum rerum curam gesserint, inter clerum magnae ecclesiae colligi vel constitui; nemo quippe militans deo saeculi negotiis implicatur. | By no means should those who have held the care of the houses of princes or suburban affairs have the power to be gathered or established among the clergy of the great church; for no one who serves God should be entangled in worldly affairs. |
| 231 | Si quis vero praeter diffinitionem quam modo praetulimus promotus fuerit in quocumque magnae ecclesiae gradu, reprobetur omnimodis ab omni ecclesiastico gradu tamquam qui contra magnam synodum provectus fuerit. | If anyone has been promoted to any rank of the great church contrary to the definition we have just set forth, let him be utterly rejected from every ecclesiastical rank as one who has been advanced against the great synod. |
| 231 | » Ecce iterum constitutionem reformatoriam denuo per octavum universale concilium post multa antiqua replicatam, et est bene advertendum, quia dicit: «reprobetur omnimodis tamquam qui contra magnam synodum provectus fuerit». | Behold, again the reforming constitution is reiterated through the eighth universal council after many ancient ones, and it is well to note that it says: "let him be utterly rejected as one who has been advanced against the great synod." |
| 232 | Ex quo patet quod, si invitis daretur episcopus, quoniam contra magnam synodum est, quae per electionis viam statuit esse providendum, quod tunc reprobari posset sic datus. | From this it is clear that if a bishop were given against the will of the people, since it is against the great synod, which established that provision should be made through the way of election, then such a given bishop could be rejected. |
| 232 | Et hoc probat textus 61 di. | And this is proven by the text of 61 Dist. |
| 232 | Nullus invitis detur episcopus, ubi istud capitulum iam supra positum proxime per Caelestinum diffinitur qui dicit quod clerici facultatem habeant renitendi, si se contra huiusmodi decretum viderint praegravari. | Let no bishop be given against the will of the people, where this chapter has already been set forth recently by Celestine, who says that the clergy have the right to resist if they see themselves burdened against such a decree. |
| 232 | Et quos sibi ingeri ex transverso viderint, non timeant refutare, facit c. | And those whom they see thrust upon them sideways, let them not fear to refuse, as is done in the chapter. |
| 232 | Obitum eiusdem di. | The death of the same Dist. |
| 232 | et ad idem 63 di. | And to the same 63 Dist. |
| 232 | Si forte, ubi dicit textus quod duobus in discordia electis metropolitani iudicio detur unus, qui petitus sit. | If perhaps, where the text says that when two are elected in discord, one should be given by the judgment of the metropolitan, who is sought. |
| 232 | Et nullus detur invitis, ne plebs invita episcopum non optatum contempnat. | And let no one be given against the will of the people, lest the unwilling people despise an unwanted bishop. |
| 232 | Et facit ad hoc bene 31 q. | And this is well supported by 31 Q. |
| 232 | 2 De neptis, quia, si unum corpus spirituale constitui debet ex episcopo et plebe, tunc consensus necessarius videtur, ut ibi de matrimonio carnali dicitur, quoniam non dubium inter episcopum et ecclesiam matrimonium est, 3 q. | 2 De neptis, because if one spiritual body is to be constituted from the bishop and the people, then consent seems necessary, as it is said there about carnal marriage, since there is no doubt that there is a marriage between the bishop and the church, 3 Q. |
| 232 | 2 Audivimus cum similibus. | 2 Audivimus with similar things. |
| 232 | Et propterea dicit textus 1 q. | And therefore the text says 1 Q. |
| 232 | 1 Ordinationes, quod ordinationes, quae non fiunt communi consensu clericorum vel populorum secundum canonicas sanctiones et ab hiis, ad quos consecratio pertinet, non comprobantur, falsas esse iudicamus, quoniam qui taliter ordinantur, non per ostium, id est Christum, intrant, sed, ut ipsa veritas testatur, fures sunt et latrones. | 1 Ordinationes, that ordinations which are not made by the common consent of the clergy or the people according to canonical sanctions and by those to whom consecration pertains, we judge to be false, since those who are ordained in such a way do not enter through the door, that is Christ, but, as the truth itself testifies, they are thieves and robbers. |
| 233 | Et ratio huius est, quoniam consensus de essentia matrimonii est, ut superius habetur. | And the reason for this is that consent is of the essence of marriage, as is held above. |
| 233 | Diversitas enim ordinum praepositorum et subiectorum pro conservatione rei publicae ordinata est, ut, dum reverentiam exhibent minores potioribus et potiores minoribus dilectionem, vera concordia ex diversitate contexeretur et recte officiorum generaretur administratio, ut 89 di. | For the diversity of orders of superiors and inferiors is ordained for the preservation of the republic, so that while the lesser show reverence to the greater and the greater show love to the lesser, true concord may be woven from diversity and the right administration of offices may be generated, as in 89 Dist. |
| 233 | Ad hoc, 45 di. | To this, 45 Dist. |
| 233 | Licet. | Although. |
| 233 | Igitur ex concordantia subsistit ecclesia; quare invitis praeses non recte praeponitur, de quo pulchre 83 di. | Therefore, the church subsists from concord; wherefore a leader is not rightly placed over the unwilling, as is beautifully said in 83 Dist. |
| 233 | Esto, sed oportet quod ille qui praeest ab omnibus quibus praeest, constituatur tacite vel expresse. | Be it so, but it is necessary that he who presides be constituted by all over whom he presides, either tacitly or expressly. |
| 233 | Sin autem aliter praesumptum fuerit, viribus carere dubium non est, quia irritum est, 66 di. | But if it is presumed otherwise, there is no doubt that it lacks force, because it is void, 66 Dist. |
| 233 | Archiepiscopus, qui est textus Anicii papae, qui dicit alibi: «Oportet, qui omnibus praeesse debet, ab omnibus eligatur. | The archbishop, which is the text of Pope Anicius, who says elsewhere: "He who is to preside over all ought to be chosen by all." |
| 233 | » Et quod ille textus Archiepiscopus, qui loquitur de ordinatione, intelligatur de electione, patet in originali et in Panormia Ivonis qui dicit: «Oportet autem, ut ille, qui omnibus praeesse videtur, ab omnibus illis eligatur et ordinetur. | And that the text Archbishop, which speaks of ordination, is understood to mean election, is clear in the original and in the Panormia of Ivo, who says: "It is necessary, however, that he who is seen to preside over all be chosen and ordained by all of them." |
| 233 | » Verbum ‘oportet’ est verbum necessitatis, 50 di. | The word 'it is necessary' is a word of necessity, 50 Dist. |

| 233 | Unde in constituendis rectoribus ecclesiasticis, qui invitis dari non debent, divina praecepta sunt, ut per electionem procedatur. | Therefore, in constituting ecclesiastical rulers, who ought not to be given against the will of the people, divine precepts are that it should proceed through election. |
| 234 | Et ut paucis contentemur allegationibus, ita scribit sanctus Cyprianus in epistula de Martiale et Basilide, ubi dicit quod «plebs in sua potestate habet eligendi dignos sacerdotes vel indignos recusandi. | And to be content with a few citations, thus writes Saint Cyprian in the letter on Martial and Basilides, where he says that "the people have in their power the choice of worthy priests or the refusal of unworthy ones." |
| 234 | Quod et ipsum, dicit, videmus de divina auctoritate descendere, ut sacerdos plebe praesente sub omnium oculis deligatur et dignus atque idoneus publico iudicio ac testimonio comprobetur, sicut in Numeris dominus Moysi praecepit: Prende Aaron, fratrem tuum, et Eleazar, filium eius, et pones eos in montem coram omni synagoga et exue Aaron stolam eius et indue Eleazar, filium eius, et Aaron appositus morietur illic. | Which also, he says, we see to descend from divine authority, that the priest should be chosen in the presence of the people under the eyes of all and that the worthy and suitable should be approved by public judgment and testimony, as the Lord commanded Moses in Numbers: 'Take Aaron, your brother, and Eleazar, his son, and place them on the mountain before the whole congregation and strip Aaron of his robe and clothe Eleazar, his son, and Aaron shall be gathered and die there.' |
| 234 | Coram omni synagoga iubet deus constitui sacerdotem, id est instruit et ostendit ordines sacerdotales non nisi sub populi assistentis conscientia fieri oportere, ut plebe praesente vel detegantur malorum crimina vel bonorum merita praedicentur et sit ordinatio iusta et legitima, quae omnium suffragio et iudicio fuerit examinata. | Before the whole congregation God commands the priest to be constituted, that is, he instructs and shows that the priestly orders should not be made except under the consciousness of the assisting people, so that in the presence of the people either the crimes of the wicked may be revealed or the merits of the good may be proclaimed and the ordination may be just and legitimate, which has been examined by the suffrage and judgment of all. |
| 234 | Quod postea secundum divina mysteria servatur in Actibus apostolorum, quando de ordinando in locum Iudae Petrus ad plebem loquitur. | Which afterward according to the divine mysteries is observed in the Acts of the Apostles, when Peter speaks to the people about ordaining in the place of Judas. |
| 234 | Surrexit, inquit, Petrus in medio discentium, fuit autem turba in unum. | Peter, it says, stood up in the midst of the disciples, and there was a crowd together. |
| 234 | Nec hoc in episcoporum tantum et sacerdotum, sed in diaconorum ordinibus observasse apostolos animadvertimus, de quo et ipso in Actibus apostolorum scriptum est. | Nor did the apostles observe this only in the ordinations of bishops and priests, but also in the ordinations of deacons, about which it is also written in the Acts of the Apostles. |
| 234 | Et convocaverunt, inquit, illi duodecim totam plebem discipulorum. | And they called together, it says, the twelve the whole multitude of the disciples. |
| 234 | Quod utique idcirco tam diligenter et caute convocata plebe tota gerebatur, ne quis ad altaris ministerium vel sacerdotalem locum indignus obreperet. | Which certainly for this reason was done so diligently and cautiously with the whole multitude called together, lest anyone unworthy should creep into the ministry of the altar or the priestly place. |
| 234 | » Haec ille. | These things he says. |
| 234 | Et Actuum 6 super illo textu glossatores dicunt quod consensum multitudinis quaesiverunt duodecim apostoli omnium fidelium, qui discipuli vocabantur, et hoc, ut exemplum darent, quoniam hic ordo servandus est in ordinandis: eligere debet populus et ordinare episcopus. | And on that text of Acts 6 the glossators say that the twelve apostles sought the consent of the multitude of all the faithful, who were called disciples, and this, to give an example, because this order is to be observed in ordaining: the people should choose and the bishop ordain. |

| 235 | Unde licet legatur in epistula Clementis Petrum misisse episcopos per Gallias et alias partes et ita etiam Clementi praecepisse, ut ipse ad illas partes mitteret, ubi ipse non misisset, et sic omnes patriarchae, archiepiscopi, episcopi a sede apostolica egressi sunt – ita intelligo textum 22 di. | From which it follows that even though it is read in Clement's letter that Peter was sent by Clement to bishops in Gaul and other regions, and that Clement thus commanded himself to send to those parts where he himself had not sent, leading all patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops to depart from the apostolic see—I thus interpret the text 22 di. |
| 235 | c. | c. |
| 235 | 1, qui fuit Nicolai papae, qui paene octingentis annis fuit post Christum – licet manifestum sit quod non in omnes partes mundi de Roma missi sunt episcopi, iam enim erant multi episcopi per mundum, antequam Petrus venit Romam, ut est manifestum, quia Antiochiae et Hierosolymis etc. | 1, who was Pope Nicholas, who reigned nearly five hundred years after Christ—although it is evident that bishops were not sent from Rome to all parts of the world, for already many bishops existed throughout the world before Peter came to Rome, as is clear from Antioch and Jerusalem, etc. |
| 235 | , et etiam ex illa epistula Clementis apparet, qui scribit Iacobo Hierosolymorum, ut ipse per Orientem mittat, tamen hoc non concludit papam solum a principio patriarchas sive primates [etc. | , and even from Clement's letter it appears that he writes about sending Jacob to the East, yet this does not conclude that only the Pope from the beginning appointed patriarchs or primi [etc. |
| 235 | solus] constituisse, ut quidam dicunt adulatores, quoniam tota ecclesia sive apostoli, qui totam ecclesiam repraesentant, propinquius quam Petrus tantum primates constituerunt, 99 di. | solus] as some allege, since the whole Church or the apostles themselves, representing the entire Church, would have established primi closer than just Peter did, 99 di. |
| 235 | Nulli, qui textus dicit: «Apostoli eorumque successores etc. | No one, who reads: “Apostles and their successors, etc.” |
| 235 | » Neque concludit ecclesiis aliquando fuisse provisum sine electione, quia tunc non fuerunt ecclesiae, sed missi fuerunt ad aedificandas ecclesias, et ideo electio locum habere non potuit, quia ecclesia eligens tunc defecit. | ” does not conclude that churches were ever provided for without election, since at that time there were no churches, but missionaries were sent to build churches, and thus election could not take place because the electing church was lacking. |
| 236 | Unde illi sic missi gerentes figuram Christi, secundi Adae, ex costa sua, &laddscilicet&radd &ladddivini&radd verbi, sibi Evam aedificarunt quam desponsaverant. | Therefore, those thus sent, embodying Christ’s figure, as the second Adam, built Eve from themselves, that is, through divine word, whom they had espoused. |
| 236 | Et sic Evae genitae post haec non dabatur nisi sponsus desideratus. | And thus, Eve’s offspring after this was not given save to the desired spouse. |
| 236 | Sic hodie non dubium papam ad partes infidelium praedicatores mittere posse ad instar Petri vel Clementis, ut haec probat textus Nulli supra allegatus. | Thus, today there is no doubt that a Pope can send preachers to infidel regions akin to Peter or Clement, as this text Nulli above argues. |
| 236 | Et ita intelligit Hostiensis in Summa De officio legati, ubi, dum de hiis, quae sedi apostolicae dicuntur reservata, dicit erectiones cathedralium ad eum spectare. | And thus Hostiensis understands in Summa De officio legati, where, speaking of those matters concerning the apostolic see, he says that the establishment of cathedrals pertains to that seat. |
| 236 | Et ideo dicitur ab ecclesia Romana omnes dignitates originem sumpsisse, 22 di. | Hence it is said that all dignities have their origin from the Roman Church, 22 di. |

| 237 | Ecce ergo electiones de divino iure esse, praesertim quod invitus non detur populo, et consequenter est contra omnem rationem dare non expetitum. | Behold, therefore, elections are by divine right, especially since no one can be compelled by the populace, and consequently it goes against all reason to withhold unwilling consent. |
| 237 | Unde Leo papa 62 di. | Wherefore Pope Leo 62 di. |
| 237 | Nulla ratio sinit, ut inter episcopos habeantur, qui nec a clericis sint electi nec a plebibus expetiti nec a conprovincialibus episcopis cum metropolitani iudicio consecrati. | No reason allows for bishops to be held who are not elected by clergy, nor approved by the laity nor consecrated with metropolitan judgment alongside provincial bishops. |
| 237 | Ecce tria requiri ad hoc, quod praeses rationabiliter constituatur: electionem cleri, consensum plebis et iudicium metropolitani. | There are three requirements for a reasonable presidency to be established: clergy election, popular consent, and metropolitan judgment. |
| 237 | Et de hoc infinita, ut ita dicam, iura sunt. | And concerning this, there are infinite rights. |
| 237 | Si igitur ecclesia reformari debet, necessarium est divina et naturalia iura ac canonum sanctiones circa materiam electionum repeti et amplius servari. | If therefore the Church needs reform, it is necessary to restore and more strictly adhere to divine and natural laws and canonical sanctions concerning the matter of elections. |
| 237 | Unde Siricius papa de qualitate ordinandorum et eligendorum in epistula ad orthodoxos per diversas provincias scribit: «Cogitantibus nobis metum divini iudicii, fratres carissimi, et post hanc vitam unumquemque, prout gesserit, recepturum, quid veniat in querelam tacere non licuit, sed nos loqui necessitas imperavit dicente propheta: Exalta in tuba vocem tuam; et cui omnium ecclesiarum cura est, si dissimulem, audiam dominum dicentem: Reicitis mandata dei, ut traditiones vestras statuatis. | Thus Pope Siricius, in his letter to the orthodox concerning ordination and election across various provinces writes: “Being mindful of divine judgment, dearest brothers, and since to withhold this truth would not be fitting after this life, necessity compelled us to speak, as the prophet says: Raise a voice like a trumpet; and for whom the care of all churches lies, if I should be silent, I hear the Lord saying: You have set aside the commandments of God, that you establish your own traditions.” |
| 237 | Quid enim aliud est reicere mandata dei quam privato iudicio et humano consilio novis rebus constituendis liberius delectari? | What else is it to set aside divine commands but to delight in private judgment and human counsel in establishing new matters? |
| 237 | Perlatum itaque est ad conscientiam apostolicae sedis contra ecclesiasticum canonem praesumi et, quae ita sunt a maioribus ordinata, ut ne vel levi susurro debeant violari, proprias quasdam novas observationes inducere et praetermisso fundamento super arenam constituere velle domino dicente: Non transfer terminos, quos posuerunt patres tui. | Therefore, it has been hidden in the conscience of the apostolic seat against ecclesiastical canon law, presuming and introducing certain novel observations, disregarding the foundation laid by elders, as the Lord says: Do not move the boundaries which your fathers have set, 25 di. |
| 237 | Quod et sanctus quoque apostolus, novi et veteris testamenti praedicator, monet, in quo locutus est Christus: State, inquit, et tenete traditiones vestras, quas didicistis sive per verbum sive per epistulam», et infra: «De quo, carissimi mihi, ante <ad> vestram sinceritatem huiusmodi litterae cucurrerunt multo fratrum et consacerdotum consensu, ut hac nostra subscriptione firmata ecclesiasticorum canonum dispositio, quae apud Nicaeam tractata est, confirmata suo merito fundatissima permaneret. | This also warns the holy Apostle, preacher of both the new and old Testament: “Be steadfast, let your teaching be in accord with what you have been taught, whether by word or by letter,” and further: “Of this, my beloved, many brethren and priests with unanimous consent sent this letter to confirm the arrangement of ecclesiastical canons, which was treated of at Nicaea, and deservedly established on firm foundation should remain so by our subscription.” |
| 237 | » Haec ille. | Haec ille. |
| 238 | Ecce, quod contra mandatum dei est reicere canones. | Behold, to set aside canons is against divine command. |
| 238 | Unde, licet Romanus pontifex aliquando pro necessitate vel utilitate ecclesiae laxare possit praecepta canonica, quae nullatenus mutilanda sunt, hiis casibus cessantibus, ut hoc Innocentius et Gelasius dicunt 1 q. | Therefore, although the Roman Pontiff might loosen canonical precepts for necessity or utility of the Church in specific cases, which must cease, as Innocent and Gelasius say 1 q. 7 c. |
| 238 | 7 c. | Although [Gelasius] et c. |
| 238 | Etsi [Gelasius] et c. | To remedy this, however, I posit that the Pope cannot wholly abolish all rights of election and reserve ecclesiastical dispositions, since election is of both divine and human law and is a divine command to which the Pope is bound to obey, not transferring the boundaries set by the Fathers, as noted in 14 di. |
| 238 | Quod pro remedio, tamen omnia iura electionis tollere penitus et suae dispositioni reservare ecclesiasticarum dispositionem puto papam non posse, quoniam electio divini et humani iuris est et praeceptum dei est cui papa oboedire tenetur quod terminos patrum transferre non debet, faciunt ea, quae notantur 14 di. | As also 1 q. 7 Even rigor and 25 q. 1. |
| 238 | Sicut et 1 q. | Some argue that since total abolition is impossible, dispensation is granted for specific reasons mentioned. |
| 238 | 7 Nisi rigor et 25 q. | And since Roman Pontiffs have used reservations with tacit consent of the whole Church, without denying bishops rejected or reprobated, though they could have been rejected according to my judgment, taciturnity then passed for consent in such cases, which suffices for their titular status. |
| 238 | 1 Sunt quidam, quoniam in totum tollere non potest, contra quod ex causis praetactis dispensat. | Taciturnity is considered consent in public affairs when one does not oppose, if able, 63 di. |
| 239 | Et quia per tacitum consensum totius ecclesiae Romani pontifices reservationibus factis usi sunt nec sunt dati episcopi repudiati et reprobati, sicut tamen meo iudicio reprobari poterant, tunc in consensum transivit taciturnitas, quod sufficit pro titulo eorum qui praefecti sunt. | , which states: “In public matters, one who does not oppose when able is understood to consent.” |
| 239 | Taciturnitas pro consensu habetur, ut tractatur in regula Qui tacet, et hoc casu, quando non opponitur, ut notat glossa antiqua capituli Nosse 63 di. | This chapter, concerning the election of a pastor, signifies contracting ecclesiastical betrothal. |
| 239 | , quae dicit: «In publico negotio, qui se non opponit, cum possit, consentire intelligitur. | Hence, if the Church does not reject, it is understood as consenting, like a father betrothing his daughter silently, thus consenting. |
| 239 | Et capitulum eligendo pastorem intelligitur contrahere sponsalia ecclesiae. | So there. |
| 239 | Unde, cum ecclesia non reclamaverit, intelligitur consentire, velut si pater contrahat sponsalia filiae suae, si tacet, consentire intelligitur. | Thus, if the Pope supplies the father's place and bestows betrothal, and the Church remains silent and accepts, consent is understood. |
| 239 | » Haec ibi. | Thus says Laurentius c. |
| 239 | Et idem Archidiaconus 25 di. | The Archidiaconus 25 di. |
| 239 | Episcopus sine. | So in this matter, if the Pope supplies the place of the father and bestows betrothal, and the Church remains silent and accepts, consensus is understood. |
| 239 | Sic in proposito, si papa supplet locum patris et dat sponsum et ecclesia tacet et recipit, consensus intelligitur. | As Laurentius explains, ubi, where he notes that a bishop without convening his clergy cannot ordain clerics, seeking connivance and testimony from citizens, stating: “Conniventia, that is consent, which he is said to have when they know and do not contradict, ff. |
| 239 | Ita dicit Laurentius c. | Dissolved marriage l. |
| 239 | Episcopus 24 di. | § Will. |
| 239 | , ubi, cum textus diceret quod episcopus sine concilio clericorum suorum clericos non ordinet, ita ut civium conniventiam et testimonium quaerat, dicit Laurentius: «Conniventia, id est consensus, quem eo ipse dicitur habere, quod sciunt et non contradicunt, ff. | ” And this text Cum Adrianus 63 di. |
| 239 | Soluto matrimonio l. | With the gloss on the word ad salutandum, which argues they consented to the election, as they interceded for him, greeted him, and did not reject him; and because greeting someone implies consent to them, 24 q. |
| 239 | 2 § Voluntatem. | 1 All etc. |
| 239 | » Et hoc probat textus Cum Adrianus 63 di. | And this is proven by the text Cum Adrianus 63 di. |
| 239 | coniuncta glossa super verbo ad salutandum, qui dicit argumentum eos consensisse electioni, ex quo interfuerunt et eum salutaverunt et non reclamaverunt; et eo quod quis salutat alium videtur consentire ei, 24 q. | with the gloss on the word "to greet," which says that they agreed to the election by the argument that they were present and greeted him and did not protest; and because one who greets another seems to consent to him, 24 q. |
| 239 | 1 Omnis etc. | 1 Every, etc. |
| 240 | Nunc autem exorbitantia ob varias laesiones displicere incipit et oritur contradictio. | Now, however, excess begins to displease due to various injuries, and a contradiction arises. |
| 240 | Quare puto papam amplius non posse generaliter reservare electiva beneficia, nisi sibi expresse indulgeretur per hoc sacrum concilium attenta contradictione exorta. | Therefore, I believe the pope can no longer generally reserve elective benefices unless expressly indulged by this holy council, with attention to the contradiction that has arisen. |
| 240 | Papa enim invitis episcopum dare non potest, ut probat textus In novo 21 di. | For the pope cannot give a bishop against the will of the bishops, as proves the text In novo 21 di. |
| 240 | , ubi dicitur Petrum voluntate apostolorum praepositum, et glossa arguit ex textu papam episcopum dare non debere nisi volentibus; 22 di. | where it is said that Peter was placed over the apostles by their will, and the gloss argues from the text that the pope should not give a bishop unless they are willing; 22 di. |

| 241 | Unde, si non deberet populi consensus intervenire in praeside, iniuste puniretur ex ignorantia vel malitia sacerdotis iuxta praemissa, cum ad eius praesidentiam eorum consensus numquam intervenit. | Hence, if the people's consensus should not intervene in the leader, they would be unjustly punished for ignorance or malice of the priest according to the above, since their consensus never intervened in his leadership. |
| 241 | Nihil enim potest tunc ipsi populo imputari, quare salus publica exigit per electionem et consensum praesides fieri. | For nothing can then be imputed to the people, since public salvation requires that a leader be chosen through election and consensus. |

| 242 | Cantantes – tunc dulcissima concordantia, non gravis, non fastidiosa adornaret templum domini. | Singers – then the sweetest harmony, not burdensome, not fastidious, would adorn the temple of the Lord. |

| 243 | Ac insuper, ut morum gravitas in singulis ordinibus servetur et maxime in episcopis, ne se <strategis> subiciant iuxta c. | And furthermore, that the gravity of morals be preserved in each order, and especially in bishops, that they not submit themselves to  according to c. |

| 244 | Ac insuper pro pace ecclesiarum statutum renovetur, quod bona 30 annis possessa ac privilegia per idem tempus habita in usu amplius in sua firmitate persistant, sicut 18 c. | And furthermore, the statute for the peace of churches should be renewed, that goods possessed for thirty years and privileges held in use for the same time should remain firm, as 18 c. |
| 244 | octavi concilii continetur. | of the eighth council contains. |
| 245 | Et post haec commendae et pensiones, quoniam sacris dispositionibus obviant, tollantur, similiter et dispensationes ad incompatibilia et beneficiorum pluralitas, et quod quisque in uno competenti beneficio divinis vacet, sicut hoc per universalia paene omnia concilia exstat diffinitum et repetitur secunda parte 23 capituli octavi concilii. | And after this, commendations and pensions, because they oppose sacred dispositions, should be removed, similarly dispensations for incompatibilities and the plurality of benefices, and that each person hold only one competent benefice to serve divine matters, as this is nearly universally defined and repeated in the second part of 23 of the eighth council. |
| 245 | Unde tanta pluralitas parvorum beneficiorum et subsequenter multorum sacerdotum ignarorum multum decolorat ecclesiam et facit laicos clericis infestos esse, dum tot sacerdotes conspiciunt, quos vident otio et vitiis vacare. | Hence such great plurality of small benefices and consequently many ignorant priests greatly dishonors the church and makes laymen hostile to clerics, since they see so many priests who appear to be idle and given to vices. |
| 245 | Sanctum etiam sacerdotale officium valde vilescit ex hoc, unde dicit textus 59 di. | The holy priestly office is also greatly devalued by this, hence the text says 59 di. |
| 245 | Si officia, quod pluralitas sacerdotum non sit multum utilis, quia omne magnum rarum esse debet. | If offices, that the plurality of priests is not very useful, because everything great should be rare. |
| 245 | Melius enim est paucos habere bonos, De aetate et qualitate: Cum sit ars artium. | For it is better to have a few good ones, De aetate et qualitate: Since it is the art of arts. |
| 246 | Et quia de simonia, de concubinatu, de conciliis universalibus et provincialibus ac de electione sacrum concilium per decreta incepit providere, providebit sancto spiritu de hiis omnibus et reducet ad ordinationem canonicam omnes pestiferas ex avaritia ortum habentes observantias, ut quisque suae curae et ministerio satisfaciat. | And since the sacred council has begun to provide for simony, concubinage, universal and provincial councils, and election through decrees, it will provide for all these by the holy spirit and reduce to canonical order all pestilent observances born of avarice, so that each may fulfill their care and ministry. |
| 246 | Et cogitabit de modo coertionem et vigorem legibus et constitutionibus indicendi et quomodo exsecutio valida et stabilis, rigorosa et immaculata sacrarum sanctionum fiat. | And it will consider the method of enforcing and giving vigor to laws and constitutions, and how valid and stable, rigorous and spotless execution of sacred sanctions may be carried out. |
| 246 | Et in hoc consistit tota vis, quia non deficiunt canones, sed exsecutiones. | And in this lies the whole force, for canons do not fail, but their executions do. |
| 246 | Et non fiunt diligentes exsecutiones nisi per bonos praesides, quibus habitis per legem animatam faciliter et subito paternas vias repeteremus. | And diligent executions are not made unless through good leaders, with whom, if they were held by a living law, we could easily and quickly return to paternal ways. |
| 247 | Capitulum XXXIV. | Chapter XXXIV. |
| 247 | Labor omnis praecedentis opusculi concordantiam qua subsistit ecclesia incepit ex altis et primis principiis investigare. | This entire preceding work began to investigate the concordance upon which the Church subsists from the highest and first principles. |
| 247 | Ordo vero, etsi non ita, ut studio plano facile conferre possit, seriatim intentum ostendit, hoc tamen in summa nititur explanare. | The order, although not such that it can easily be presented in a straightforward study, shows the intent serially; nevertheless, it strives to explain this in summary. |
| 247 | Nulli est dubium Christum esse viam, vitam et veritatem, caput et fundamentum ecclesiae, ad Ephesios 4 et 5 et 1 ad Corinthios 10 et in glossa super illud Matthaei 16: «Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram», et per Augustinum in libro Retractationum, super Ioannem, in multis sermonibus ac alios multos, immo paene omnes doctores. | There is no doubt that Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, the head and foundation of the Church, according to Ephesians 4 and 5, and 1 Corinthians 10, and in the gloss on Matthew 16: "You are Peter, and upon this rock," and through Augustine in the book of Retractations, on John, in many sermons and many others, indeed almost all doctors. |
| 247 | In hac quidem ecclesia fides non deficiet, quia exauditus est Christus, qui usque ad saeculi consummationem cum successoribus apostolorum remanebit. | In this Church, faith will not fail, because Christ has been heard, who will remain with the successors of the apostles until the consummation of the age. |
| 247 | Unde erunt semper Christi fideles, in quibus habitabit ipse Christus. | Therefore, there will always be Christ's faithful, in whom Christ himself will dwell. |
| 247 | Quare illud corpus fidelium, in quo Christus habitabit, christiforme ecclesia catholica dicitur, in qua, sicut Christus, ita et via et veritas semper permanebit. | Therefore, that body of the faithful, in which Christ will dwell, is called the christ-formed Catholic Church, in which, as Christ, so also the way and the truth will always remain. |
| 247 | Quomodo autem ex omnibus rationabilibus spiritibus Christo adhaerentibus ipsa universorum unica constituatur ecclesia, ac etiam quomodo in ipsa omnium ecclesia trinitas ex eius parte triumphantium et alia militantium et tertia dormientium, ac insuper quomodo colligantia ipsius militantis, ubi adhuc ipsa veritas, scilicet Christus, in figura et aenigmate apprehenditur, ad ipsam veritatem facialem, quae est in patria triumphantium, investigetur, ut admirandus ordo, quantum possibile est, aliquantulum pro nostra manuductione sciatur cum diversis et ad invicem ordinatissimis huius militantis ecclesiae hierarchiis, pro modulo succincte aperui in prima huius parte, quae pars compendiosius stringi vix possit. | Now, how from all rational spirits adhering to Christ the one universal Church is constituted, and also how in this Church of all, the trinity of those triumphant, others militant, and a third sleeping, and furthermore how the connection of the militant Church, where the truth itself, namely Christ, is apprehended in figure and enigma, is investigated to the face-to-face truth which is in the homeland of the triumphant, so that the admirable order, as far as possible, may be somewhat known for our guidance with the diverse and mutually ordered hierarchies of this militant Church, I have briefly opened in the first part of this, which part can scarcely be more concisely summarized. |
| 248 | Post haec secunda parte difficultatem maioritatis conciliorum universae ecclesiae super omnem particularem auctoritatem singularis praesidis aut synodi localis volens indagare ex hoc fundamento primo intellectum discursivum direxi hanc apprehendens conclusionem: Si universalis catholica ecclesia infallibiliter per Christi assistentiam dirigitur, tunc concurrente omnium Christianorum consensu ad quamcumque conclusionem necessitatem salutis includentem necessario sequitur illam Christianam fidelem et veram. | After this, wishing to investigate in the second part the difficulty of the majority of the councils of the universal Church over all particular authority of a singular president or local synod from this first foundation, I directed this discursive understanding, apprehending this conclusion: If the universal Catholic Church is infallibly directed by Christ's assistance, then with the concurrence of the consensus of all Christians to any conclusion including the necessity of salvation, that Christian faith necessarily follows and is true. |
| 248 | Universale vero concilium dictans talem conclusionem consensu et legatione omnium fidelium necessario ex Christi assistentia et sancto spiritu inspirante vere et infallibiliter dictat eandem, nulla enim potest esse veritas ad aeternam salutem dirigens nisi per Christum. | A universal council dictating such a conclusion by the consensus and legation of all the faithful necessarily dictates the same truly and infallibly from Christ's assistance and the inspiring Holy Spirit, for no truth can lead to eternal salvation except through Christ. |
| 248 | Universale autem concilium ex praesidibus et legatis collectum, qui ad ipsam congregationem rei investigabilis dubio in provincia propria non digesto, dum sic in vago confluunt ad consulendum consensu subiectorum non apportato ad haec, si rite et legitime convocatum et omnibus vocatis collectum, liberrime celebratum et iuste finitum communi omnium consensu sententiam &laddin&radd quomodolibet salutem fidelium concernentibus dictaverit, propter propinquam repraesentationem totius catholicae ecclesiae et propter omnium fidelium consensum, qui per legatos ac praesides concurrit, numquam legimus errasse. | A universal council, however, gathered from presidents and legates, who have not digested a matter of investigable doubt in their own province, while thus they flow together vaguely to consult without the consent of the subjects being brought to this, if it is rightly and legitimately convened and gathered with all called, celebrated freely and justly concluded with the common consent of all, has dictated a sentence concerning the salvation of the faithful in any way, because of the close representation of the whole Catholic Church and because of the consent of all the faithful, which concurs through legates and presidents, we have never read that it has erred. |
| 249 | Omnes autem provinciales synodos ac etiam Romanos pontifices hoc privilegium non attingit. | But this privilege does not extend to all provincial synods or even to the Roman pontiffs. |
| 249 | Et quoniam ob varias praesertim modernorum iuristarum ac theologorum scripturas, qui papalis dignitatis etiam super ipsas synodicas auctoritates exaltant potentiam, necessarium fuit inquirere concordantias scripturarum remanente veritate praefata, repertas differentias inter universale catholicae ecclesiae ac universale nationis, regni vel patriarchale iuxta gesta conciliorum, quae quidem gesta, ut 19 di. | And since, because of various writings, especially of modern jurists and theologians, who exalt the power of papal dignity even above synodal authorities, it was necessary to inquire into the concordances of the scriptures, the aforementioned truth remaining, the differences found between the universal Catholic Church and the universal nation, kingdom, or patriarchal, according to the acts of the councils, which acts, as is read in 19 d. |
| 249 | c. | c. |
| 249 | 1 legitur, approbata sunt, inserui, ut quisque intellecta differentia facile videat hoc verum, scilicet quod universale concilium catholicae ecclesiae supremam habet potestatem in omnibus super ipsum Romanum pontificem. | 1, have been approved, I have inserted, so that everyone, understanding the difference, may easily see this truth, namely that the universal council of the Catholic Church has supreme power in all things over the Roman pontiff. |
| 249 | Erat itaque necessarium inquirere, quae Romani pontificis auctoritas tam in superioritate quam praeceptione et statutorum editione. | Therefore, it was necessary to inquire what the authority of the Roman pontiff is, both in superiority and precept and in the issuing of statutes. |
| 249 | Et licet induxerim multa, tamen in hoc resedi quod, licet secundum plura sanctorum scripta potestas Romani pontificis a deo sit et secundum alia ab homine et conciliis universalibus, tamen videtur in veritate medium concordantiae per scripturas investigabile ad hoc demum tendere, quod ipsius pontificis Romani potestas quoad considerationem praeeminentiae, prioratus et principatus sit a deo per medium hominis et conciliorum, scilicet mediante consensu electivo. | And although I have introduced many things, yet I have settled on this, that although according to the writings of many saints the power of the Roman pontiff is from God and according to others from man and universal councils, nevertheless it seems that the middle of concordance through scripture is investigable to this end, that the power of the Roman pontiff as regards the consideration of preeminence, priority, and principality is from God through man and councils, namely by means of elective consent. |
| 250 | Consideravi enim primo legem Christianam liberrimam, ad quam nullus nisi sponte absque coactione accedit. | For I considered first the Christian law to be most free, to which no one comes except voluntarily without coercion. |
| 250 | Unde cum via fidei nostrae sit ipse Christus, non est in ipsis ad salutem necessariis aliud quam ipse Christus et ad eum liberrimus accessus. | Therefore, since the way of our faith is Christ himself, there is nothing in those things necessary for salvation other than Christ himself and the most free access to him. |
| 250 | Quare coactio proprie non est in ipsa ecclesia descensive a Christo, sed gratia est, quae ab ipsa plenitudine fontis capitis in ipsum corpus Christi mysticum fluit. | Therefore, coercion properly does not descend into the Church from Christ, but it is grace which flows from the fullness of the fountainhead into the mystical body of Christ. |
| 250 | Et ita dicit 7 q. | And thus it says 7 q. |
| 250 | 1 Remoto, quod gratia dignitatum sacerdotalium a deo est. | 1 Removed, that the grace of priestly dignities is from God. |
| 251 | In hac quidem gratia dicimus quoad apostolatum omnes apostolos aequales, sicut ad ipsum sacerdotium omnes sacerdotes, sed abundantiori gratia dicimus Petrum inter apostolos primum. | In this grace, we say that as regards the apostleship, all apostles are equal, just as in the priesthood all priests are equal, but with more abundant grace we say Peter was first among the apostles. |
| 251 | Ita dicit Augustinus super Ioannem sermone ultimo quod Petrus abundantiori gratia fuit unus idemque primus apostolus et propter primatum apostolatus gerebat figurata qualitate personam ecclesiae. | Thus Augustine says in the last sermon on John that Peter was one and the same first apostle with more abundant grace and because of the primacy of the apostleship he bore the figurative quality of the person of the Church. |
| 251 | Et illum primatum Petri, quo ipse abundantiori gratia a Christo dotatus fuit, sacrae litterae mihi exprimunt ibi, cum Christus diceret: «Tu vocaberis Cephas», quod interpretatur Petrus, Ioannis primo, ubi dicit Augustinus sermone 7 sic: «Magnum mutavit ei nomen et fecit de Simone Petrum. | And that primacy of Peter, by which he was endowed with more abundant grace by Christ, sacred scripture expresses for me there, when Christ said: "You will be called Cephas," which is interpreted Peter, John 1, where Augustine says in sermon 7 thus: "He greatly changed his name and made Peter out of Simon. |
| 251 | Petrus autem a petra, petra vero ecclesia. | Peter, however, from petra, petra, however, the Church. |
| 251 | Ergo in Petri nomine figurata est ecclesia. | Therefore, the Church was figured in the name of Peter. |
| 251 | » Ecce, quod secundum intellectum maximi et doctissimi Augustini illa nominis mutatio magna fuit. | "Behold, that according to the understanding of the greatest and most learned Augustine, that change of name was great. |
| 251 | Unde cum Christus diceret: «Tu es Petrus», tunc illud quod praedixerat: «Tu vocaberis Cephas», tamquam futurum contulit in praesens. | Therefore, when Christ said: "You are Peter," then that which he had foretold: "You will be called Cephas," he conferred as future into the present. |
| 251 | Non enim tunc dixit: «Tu nominaris vel vocaris Petrus», sed: «Tu es Petrus». | For he did not then say: "You are named or called Peter," but: "You are Peter." |
| 251 | Ex quo apparet manifeste quod illa Christi promissio, qua promisit converso Simoni eum in futuro Cephas nominandum, fuit promissio realis primatiae. | From which it appears manifestly that that promise of Christ, by which he promised to the converted Simon that he would be named Cephas in the future, was a real promise of primacy. |
| 251 | Unde Augustinus, qui dicit Petrum primatum habuisse inter apostolos, non potest intelligi de tempore conversionis aut cognitionis Messiae, sicut Petrus agnoscens interpretatur secundum aliquos, licet minus congrue secundum Bedam, sicut Alexander de Halis super Ioannem et eodem verbo ponit, quia iam praecessit eum frater suus Andreas, qui sibi Messiam inventum praenuntiabat, ut legitur Ioannis 1. | Therefore, Augustine, who says that Peter had primacy among the apostles, cannot be understood as of the time of conversion or knowledge of the Messiah, as Peter acknowledging interprets according to some, although less congruously according to Bede, as Alexander of Hales puts it on John and in the same word, because his brother Andrew preceded him, who announced to him that the Messiah had been found, as is read in John 1. |
| 251 | Quare de primatu inter alios de ecclesia ipse Augustinus necessario intelligit quoad praesidentiam et eminentiam, quam ibi consecutus est Petrus, postquam collegium apostolorum perfectum fuit, dum Christus diceret: «Tu es Petrus. | Therefore, of the primacy among others of the Church, Augustine himself necessarily understands as regards the presidency and eminence which Peter obtained there, after the college of apostles was perfected, when Christ said: "You are Peter. |
| 252 | Et ex superioribus manifestum est Simonem a re Petrum vel Cepham nominatum. | And from the above, it is clear that Simon was named Peter or Cephas concerning the matter of Peter. |
| 252 | Hieronymus vero super Galatas dicit principem apostolorum iam Petrum, iam Cepham nominari non ob diversitatem interpretationum, quoniam idem significant. | Jerome, indeed, commenting on the Galatians, says that Peter, already the prince of the apostles, was also called Cephas, not because of a difference in interpretations, since they signify the same thing. |
| 252 | Petrus enim Graece et Latine a petra dictum idem est quod Cephas. | For Peter, in Greek and Latin, is said to be derived from "petra," which is the same as Cephas. |
| 252 | Petrus vero Beda Hebraeum negat, quia dicit hanc litteram p apud Hebraeos non haberi. | But Bede denies that Peter is Hebrew, because he says that the letter "p" is not found among the Hebrews. |
| 252 | Alexander de Halis in postillis super Ioannem dicit Hieronymum dicere idem. | Alexander of Hales, in his postils on John, says that Jerome says the same thing. |
| 252 | Nec Cephas est Hebraeum, sed Syrianum, ut quidam dicunt. | And Cephas is not Hebrew, but Syrian, as some say. |
| 252 | Qualitercumque hoc sit propter textum qui dicit: «Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram», oporteret cum Augustino, Ambrosio et aliis doctoribus affirmare Petrum esse a petra dictum. | However this may be, because of the text that says, "You are Peter and on this rock," it would be fitting, with Augustine, Ambrose, and other doctors, to affirm that Peter is named from the rock. |
| 252 | Et Petrus sic est nomen Latinum et non Hebraeum. | And Peter is thus a Latin name and not Hebrew. |
| 252 | Et hoc videtur e textu Ioannis 1 ita probari, quia Ioannes praemittit in eodem capitulo immediate illum locum duo Hebraea, scilicet rabbi et Messias et adiungit interpretationem immediate. | And this seems to be proven from the text of John 1, because John immediately precedes that place with two Hebrew words, namely "rabbi" and "Messias," and he adds the interpretation immediately. |
| 252 | Sic videtur etiam quod Cephas sit vel Syrianum vel Hebraeum et Petrus eius interpretatio Latina vel Graeca et non e converso, scilicet quod Cephas sit Graecum quod Hebraice Petrus interpretetur. | Thus it seems that Cephas is either Syrian or Hebrew, and Peter is its Latin or Greek interpretation, and not the other way around, namely that Cephas is Greek, which is interpreted as Peter in Hebrew. |
| 253 | Et dum haec ego scriberem, incidit unum meo iudicio satis advertendum, quia textus Ioannis 1 dicit quod hoc nomen Petrus est interpretatio huius nominis Cephas. | And while I was writing these things, something occurred to me that is worthy of notice, because the text of John 1 says that the name Peter is the interpretation of the name Cephas. |
| 253 | Quare, cum cephe Graecum caput apud Latinos interpretetur, oportet et illam interpretationem hoc nomen Petrus habere et non aliquam de illis interpretationibus, quas sanctus Hieronymus ponit Hebraicorum nominum. | Therefore, since the Greek word "cephas" is interpreted as "head" among the Latins, it is fitting that this name Peter also have that interpretation, and not one of those interpretations that St. Jerome posits for Hebrew names. |
| 253 | Non dubium Ioannem evangelistam Graece scripsisse evangelium et sic interpretationem propriam nominis Petri posuisse ad ostendendum quod hoc nomen, quod Christus Simoni imposuit, sibi ex illa interpretatione congrueret. | There is no doubt that John the Evangelist wrote the Gospel in Greek and thus placed his own interpretation of the name Peter to show that this name, which Christ imposed on Simon, was congruent with that interpretation. |
| 253 | Quare forte non esset absurdum dicere nomen Petrus iuxta Hebraeam linguam bet-ros dici et sic apud nos pet positum loco bet eapropter, quia bet illud Hebraeum cum forti et dura expressione primae litterae, scilicet b, exprimitur, quasi sicut nos p proferimus et secundum hoc Petrus resolvendo ad illud Hebraeum caput domus interpretaretur. | Therefore, it might not be absurd to say that the name Peter is said to be "bet-ros" in the Hebrew language, and thus "pet" is placed among us in place of "bet," because "bet," that Hebrew word, is expressed with a strong and hard pronunciation of the first letter, namely "b," as if we were to pronounce "p," and according to this, Peter, when resolved to that Hebrew word, would be interpreted as "head of the house." |
| 253 | Et haec interpretatio conveniret evangelio et intentioni Christi secundum ipsum evangelium et expositionem sanctorum, qui caput ecclesiae sive domus Petrum a Christo dicunt constitutum. | And this interpretation would be in agreement with the Gospel and the intention of Christ, according to the Gospel itself and the exposition of the saints, who say that Peter was constituted by Christ as the head of the church or house. |
| 253 | Ad quod facit c. | This is also stated in c. |
| 253 | Sacrosancta 22 di. | In Sacrosancta 22, di. |
| 253 | , ubi terminus Cephas interpretatur caput, quare Cephas Graecum est. | where the term Cephas is interpreted as "head," therefore Cephas is Greek. |
| 254 | Ego vero potius credo standum cum primis doctoribus non obstante textu Sacrosancta, qui Anacleto ascribitur, quoniam illas Anacleti epistulas apocryphas credo, ut infra in tertia parte dico. | I, however, believe that it is better to stand with the first doctors, notwithstanding the text of Sacrosancta, which is ascribed to Anacletus, because I believe that those letters of Anacletus are apocryphal, as I say below in the third part. |
| 254 | Non tamen nego, quin ultima consideratio notanda sit. | Nevertheless, I do not deny that the last consideration is noteworthy. |
| 254 | Et secundum eam in Actibus apostolorum primo capitulo Petrus primo nominatur ut caput et ea proposuit pro exsecutione mandatorum Christi, quae sibi ut primo et capiti principalius commissa a Christo fuere. | And according to it, in the Acts of the Apostles, chapter 1, Peter is first named as head, and he proposed this for the execution of Christ's mandates, which were committed to him by Christ as the first and principal one. |
| 254 | Unde licet omnes apostoli rectores, pastores et vicarii Christi fuere, ut in praefatione missae in cuiuslibet festivitate decantatur, tamen in pastoratu illo, rectoratu et vicariatu abundantiori gratia Petrum primatum habuisse sancti doctores affirmant per hoc, quod sibi ut ecclesiam totam repraesentanti claves promissae et datae fuere ac pastoratus praeceptus per verba: «Pasce oves». | Whence, although all the apostles were rectors, pastors, and vicars of Christ, as is sung in the preface of the Mass on any feast day, nevertheless, in that pastoral office, rectorate, and vicariate, the holy doctors affirm that Peter had the primacy, because to him, as the one representing the whole church, the keys were promised and given, and the precept of pastoral care was given through the words: "Feed my sheep." |
| 255 | Illum autem pastoratum Petrus inter alios primum et principaliter sortitus immediate post Christi ascensionem incepit in omni congregatione fidelium exsecutioni demandare, sicut praesides monere et respondere solent. | That pastoral office, Peter, among others, first and principally undertook immediately after Christ's ascension, beginning to demand execution in every congregation of the faithful, just as presidents are accustomed to admonish and respond. |
| 255 | Unde primus fuit Petrus, qui vicariatum Christi verbo doctrinae et baptizandi officio Hierosolymis se habere ostendit et primum inter apostolos, ut in Actibus 1, 2 et 3 capitulis legitur et Lucae 6. | Whence Peter was the first who showed that he had the vicariate of Christ by the word of doctrine and the office of baptizing in Jerusalem, and he was the first among the apostles, as is read in Acts 1, 2, and 3, and in Luke 6. |
| 255 | Similiter ex eisdem locis patet ipsum Petrum primum episcopum Hierosolymorum, quia ea exercuit, quae episcopalis ordo requirit. | Similarly, from the same places, it is clear that Peter was the first bishop of Jerusalem, because he exercised those things that the episcopal order requires. |
| 255 | Et fuit post hoc episcopus Antiochiae, ut hoc legitur ad Galatas 2, deinde Romae, ubi ipse epistulam primam scripsit, ut patet ex fine eius, ubi dicit: «Salutat vos ecclesia, quae est in Babylone. | And after this, he was bishop of Antioch, as is read in Galatians 2, then in Rome, where he wrote his first epistle, as is clear from the end of it, where he says: "The church that is in Babylon greets you." |
| 255 | » Et secundum Hieronymum et Bedam et exponentes omnes quos vidi illa Babylon fuit Roma, quia filia Babylonis antiquae. | And according to Jerome and Bede and all the exponents whom I have seen, that Babylon was Rome, because it was the daughter of ancient Babylon. |
| 255 | Recte enim, ut se habuit monarchia Babylonica, ita praecise Romana, ut hoc Paulus Orosius in principio septimi libri Historiarum late declarat. | For just as the Babylonian monarchy was, so precisely was the Roman monarchy, as Paulus Orosius declares at length in the beginning of the seventh book of his Histories. |
| 255 | Et expositores Apocalypsis diffuse scribunt, quomodo Babylonicum regnum sit ipsum Romanum. | And the exponents of the Apocalypse write at length about how the Babylonian kingdom is the same as the Roman kingdom. |
| 255 | Et non est nostri propositi. | And this is not our purpose. |
| 256 | Sufficit nobis, licet quidam Marsilius de Padua, quem post omnem collectionem istius voluminis vidi, quodam loco secundae partis dicere videatur per canonem Bibliae non posse probari Petrum episcopum Romanum, immo aut Romae fuisse, quod hoc ex ipsa epistula Petri praefata secundum expositionem doctorum falsum est. | It is enough for us, although Marsilius of Padua, whom I saw after collecting all of this volume, seems to say in a certain place in the second part that it cannot be proven by the canon of the Bible that Peter was bishop of Rome, or even that he was in Rome, which is false according to the aforementioned epistle of Peter, according to the exposition of the doctors. |
| 256 | Et non est usque ad haec tempora quisquam doctorum sanctorum inventus, qui hoc umquam negaverit, immo Alypius, Augustinus etc. | And there is no doctor of the saints who has been found to have ever denied this, but rather Alypius, Augustine, etc. |
| 256 | , Optatus Milevitanus, sanctus Hieronymus ac alii omnes, qui Romanorum pontificum catalogum suis scriptis inseruerunt, a Petro incipiunt. | Optatus of Milevis, St. Jerome, and all the others who have inserted the catalog of the Roman pontiffs into their writings begin with Peter. |
| 256 | Et dicit Optatus libro secundo contra Parmenianum quod hoc non habet dubium sedem Romanam per omnes successores connumerando usque ad Petrum qui primus ibi sedit, continuari et per illum Christo coniungi, et puto nullum catholicum sanctis patribus, quorum scripta per ecclesiam approbata sunt, in hoc dissentire posse. | And Optatus says in book 2 against Parmenian that this is not doubtful, that the Roman see is continued through all the successors, counting back to Peter, who first sat there, and is joined to Christ through him, and I think that no Catholic can dissent from the holy fathers, whose writings have been approved by the church, on this point. |
| 256 | Praedictis autem consentiunt doctores approbati. | The aforesaid doctors, however, agree with the approved doctors. |
| 256 | Sanctus Hieronymus libro 1 contra Iovinianum, ubi, dum Iovinianus sibi obiceret contra laudem virginitatis quod ecclesia non super Ioannem, sed Petrum fundata esset, dicit sanctus Hieronymus: «Super Petrum fundatur ecclesia, licet alio loco super omnes apostolos fiat et cuncti claves regni caelorum accipiant et ex aequo super eos ecclesiae fortitudo solidetur, tamen propterea inter 12 unus eligitur, ut capite constituto scismatis tollatur occasio. | St. Jerome, in book 1 against Jovinian, where Jovinian objected to him against the praise of virginity that the church was not founded on John, but on Peter, says: "The church is founded on Peter, although in another place it is founded on all the apostles, and all receive the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the strength of the church is equally established on them, nevertheless, one is chosen among the twelve, so that the occasion of schism may be removed by the established head." |
| 256 | Sed cur non Ioannes electus est virgo? | But why was John not chosen, being a virgin? |
| 256 | Aetati delatum est, quia Petrus senior erat, ne adhuc adolescens et paene puer progressae aetatis hominibus praeferretur et magister bonus, qui occasionem iurgii debuerat a discipulis auferre et dixit ad eos: Pacem meam do vobis, pacem relinquo vobis, et: Qui voluerit inter vos maior esse, minor omnium sit, ne in adolescentem quem dilexerat causam praeberet invidiae. | It was deferred to his age, because Peter was older, lest a young man, almost a boy, be preferred to men of advanced age, and a good master, who ought to remove the occasion of strife from his disciples, said to them: "I give you my peace, I leave you my peace," and: "Whoever wants to be greater among you, let him be the least of all," so that he would not give cause for envy to the young man whom he loved. |
| 256 | » Haec ille. | These are his words. |
| 256 | Ecce sententiam sancti Hieronymi, cui non licet contradicere. | Behold, the opinion of St. Jerome, whom it is not lawful to contradict. |
| 256 | Ex qua habetur Petrum caput constitutum apostolorum et eis per Christum praelatum non obstante, quod ipsa ecclesia ex aequo super omnes apostolos sit fundata. | From which it is understood that Peter was constituted as the head of the apostles and was preferred to them by Christ, notwithstanding that the church itself is founded equally on all the apostles. |
| 256 | Et quod Romae Petrus sedit, idem ad Damasum papam scribens de fide sua dicit: «Haec est fides», et infra: «Qui Petri fidem et sedem tenes». | And that Peter sat in Rome, the same is said by him when writing to Pope Damasus about his faith: "This is the faith," and below: "Who keeps the faith and see of Peter." |
| 256 | Ad idem Cyprianus 24 q. | To the same, Cyprian 24, q. |
| 256 | 1 Loquitur, Gregorius 50 di. | 1, speaks, and Gregory 50, di. |
| 256 | Considerandum et Ambrosius eadem di. | And Ambrose, in the same di., is to be considered. |
| 256 | Fidelior, Clemens 80 di. | And more faithfully, Clement 80, di. |
| 256 | In illis, Augustinus 2 q. | In those, Augustine 2, q. |
| 256 | 7 Puto, et non est opus scripturas adducere, quia ab hac sententia catholica ecclesia numquam dissensit. | 7, I think, and it is not necessary to adduce the scriptures, because the Catholic Church has never dissented from this opinion. |
| 257 | Iste autem principatus Petri non consistit in maioritate quoad ligandi et solvendi potestatem, in foro poenitentiali aut in sacramentorum confectione. | This principality of Peter, however, does not consist in a greater power of binding and loosing, in the penitential forum, or in the administration of sacraments. |
| 257 | Nec dubitat quisquam de ultimo, nec de primo est dubitandum iuxta praemissa superius, quoniam eadem est omnium episcoporum, sicut fuit omnium apostolorum spiritualis iudiciaria potestas, quoniam haec a Christo per medium sacerdotii fluit. | No one doubts the latter, nor should anyone doubt the former, based on what has been said above, since all bishops have the same spiritual judicial power as all the apostles had, because this power flows from Christ through the priesthood. |
| 257 | Ita dicit Hieronymus super illo Matthaei 16: «Quodcumque ligaveris»: «Habent quidem eandem iudiciariam potestatem alii apostoli, quibus post resurrectionem ait: Accipite spiritum sanctum. | Thus, Jerome says on Matthew 16: "Whatsoever you shall bind": "The other apostles also have the same judicial power, to whom after the resurrection he said: Receive the Holy Spirit." |
| 257 | » Haec ille. | This is what he says. |
| 257 | Et multa superius ad idem adducta sunt. | And many things have been adduced above to the same effect. |
| 257 | Nec fuit Petrus ex illo primatu ecclesiae maior, quoniam ipse ab ecclesia et propter eam nominatur secundum Augustinum loco praeallegato et Ambrosium 50 di. | Nor was Peter greater than the church on account of that primacy, because he is named by the church and for the church, according to Augustine in the previously cited passage and Ambrose, Decretum 50. |
| 257 | Fidelior et alios doctores superius adductos. | Faithful and other doctors cited above. |
| 257 | Quare illa Petri maioritas non fuit maioritas supra, sed intra ecclesiam. | Therefore, that greater status of Peter was not a superiority over but within the church. |
| 257 | Unde licet os sive caput esset apostolorum ac ecclesiae et eius nomine proponeret, ut Actuum primo et responderet, ut Actuum secundo, tamen nihilominus tamquam membrum subfuit. | Hence, although he was the mouth or head of the apostles and of the church, and proposed in its name, as in Acts 1, and responded, as in Acts 2, nevertheless, he was no less a member subject to it. |
| 257 | Quare in medio fidelium surgens in reverentiam ecclesiae locutus est et passus est se mitti in Samariam ab ipsa, Actuum 8. | Therefore, rising among the faithful, out of reverence for the church, he spoke and suffered himself to be sent to Samaria by it, Acts 8. |
| 257 | In ordine enim ad ipsam veram vitam et veritatem, Christum, dominum et caput nostrum, omnes fideles, quia filii dei sunt per regenerationem in Christo, fratres tantum sunt, quoniam ibi non est aliud magisterium quam ipse Christus, Matthaei 23: «Nolite vocari rabbi; unus est enim magister vester», Christus, «omnes autem vos fratres estis». | For in relation to that true life and truth, Christ, our Lord and head, all the faithful, because they are children of God through regeneration in Christ, are only brothers, since there is no other teaching authority than Christ himself, Matthew 23: "Do not be called Rabbi, for one is your master, Christ, and all of you are brothers." |
| 257 | Unde hoc respectu non est nisi fraternitas in Christi fidelibus, licet maioritas gratiae secundum divinam ordinationem cum eadem fraternitate persistat. | Hence, from this perspective, there is only brotherhood among the faithful of Christ, although a greater abundance of grace persists with that same brotherhood according to divine ordination. |
| 258 | Unde, licet Petrus primus foret apostolus modo dicto, tamen illa primitivitas non excessit ipsam apostolorum fraternitatem quoad ipsam ecclesiam. | Hence, although Peter was the first apostle in the manner said, yet that primacy did not exceed the brotherhood of the apostles in relation to the church itself. |
| 258 | Non enim erat Petrus plus filius dei quam alius ex sanctissimis apostolis, licet abundantiori gratia dotatus foret. | For Peter was not more a son of God than another of the most holy apostles, although he was endowed with a more abundant grace. |
| 258 | Et pro hac materia est notanda epistula sancti Gregorii papae in Registro 214 ad Ioannem patriarcham Constantinopolitanum quae incipit: Eo ] tempore, in qua vult ostendere nullum episcopum ita principatum gerere in ecclesia quod omnia membra ecclesiae sint sibi subiecta, quin immo dicit illum Lucifero similem, qui hoc praesumit, quoniam supra astra caeli solium seu sedem ponere nititur, dicens: «Quid enim fratres tui, omnes ecclesiae universalis episcopi, nisi astra caeli sunt? | And on this matter, the letter of Saint Gregory the Pope in the Register 214 to John, Patriarch of Constantinople, is to be noted, which begins: "At that time," in which he wishes to show that no bishop so exercises primacy in the church that all the members of the church are subject to him, and indeed he says that he who presumes this is similar to Lucifer. |
| 258 | Quibus dum cupis temetipsum vocabulo elato praeponere eorumque nomen tui comparatione calcare, quid aliud dicis nisi: In caelum conscendam, super astra caeli exaltabo solium meum? | For when you wish to exalt yourself above your brothers, all the bishops of the universal church, and to trample their name in comparison with yourself, what else do you say than: "I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of heaven"? |
| 258 | » Et infra: «Certe Petrus, apostolus primus, membrum sanctae et universalis ecclesiae, Paulus, Andreas, Ioannes, quid aliud quam singularium sunt plebium capita? | And below: "Certainly Peter, the first apostle, a member of the holy and universal church, Paul, Andrew, John, what are they but heads of particular peoples?" |
| 258 | Et tamen sub uno capite, Christo, omnes membra», et infra: «Nullus Romanus pontifex hoc temerarium nomen, universalis scilicet episcopus, sibi arripuit, ne, si sibi in pontificatus gradu gloriam singularitatis arripere, hanc omnibus fratribus denegasse viderentur. | And yet, all are members under one head, Christ, and below: "No Roman pontiff has assumed this rash name, that of universal bishop, lest, if he were to arrogate to himself glory of singularity in the degree of pontificate, he seemed to deny it to all his brothers." |
| 258 | » Haec ibi. | This is what he says. |
| 258 | Et idem in alia epistula 211 ad Anastasium Antiochenum quae incipit: Cum praedicator egregius, ubi deducit, quomodo omnes unum sumus in uno capite Christo, qui est pastor omnium, et nullus est homo, cui omnia Christi membra sint subiecta et per consequens nullus universalis patriarcha, quia, si hoc dici permittatur, honor omnium patriarcharum negatur et nullus iam episcopus in statu veritatis invenitur etc. | And the same in another letter, 211 to Anastasius of Antioch, which begins: "When the excellent preacher," where he deduces how all are one in one head, Christ, who is the pastor of all, and there is no man to whom all the members of Christ are subject, and consequently no universal patriarch. |
| 259 | Considerando vero singula ipsius ecclesiae membra singulariter et in se, tunc praelatio abundantiori gratia, quae propter tollere scisma necessaria fuit, ad bonum ecclesiae ordinatum regimen iuxta sancti Hieronymi sententiam a Christo Petro tradita legitur, ut ipse, sicut singulorum fuit primus, omnium esset servus et minister. | Considering, however, the individual members of the church singularly and in themselves, then a prelacy of more abundant grace, which was necessary to remove schism, was ordained for the good of the church to an orderly regimen, according to the sentence of Saint Jerome, that it was handed down by Christ to Peter, that he, just as he was the first of individuals, might be the servant and minister of all. |
| 259 | Quoniam, si propter ecclesiam Petrus a petra dictus est, et ecclesia non est nisi unio fidelium ecclesiae, propter unionem fidelium ob tollere scisma praesidentia est. | For if Peter was called "rock" on account of the church, and the church is nothing but the union of the faithful of the church, then on account of the union of the faithful for the removal of schism, there is a presidency. |
| 259 | Quare unitas fidelium est illa, ad cuius servitium et observantiam praesidentia est super singulos. | Therefore, the unity of the faithful is that for the service and observance of which there is a presidency over individuals. |
| 259 | Hinc unitas fidelium, quam nos ecclesiam dicimus, sive universale concilium catholicae ecclesiae ipsam repraesentans est supra suum ministrum ac singularem praesidem. | Hence, the unity of the faithful, which we call the church, or the universal council of the Catholic church representing it, is above its minister and singular president. |
| 259 | Et ita intelligo dictum salvatoris quod maior inter apostolos distributive debeat esse, omnium collective, quoniam sic ecclesiam faciunt, minister. | And thus I understand the saying of the Savior, that the greater among the apostles ought to be, distributively, the servant of all collectively, because in this way they make the church. |
| 259 | Nec propter hoc dico curatum praesidentem absolvi a particulari cuiuslibet subiecti ministeriali cura, quoniam, licet minister sit cuiuslibet, remanet tamen superior cuilibet, ut potestatem habeat pastoralis curae, non sic omnium collective iuxta praemissa. | Nor do I say on this account that the presiding pastor is absolved from the ministerial care of each particular subject, because, although he is the minister of each, he nevertheless remains superior to each, so that he may have the power of pastoral care, not so, however, of all collectively, according to what has been said. |
| 260 | Etiam ad ea quae superius tacta sunt, quomodo scilicet potestas principandi in ecclesia non sit quoad radicem illam, qua ipsa a deo est, proprie in coactione constituta, sed ministeriali cura, probatur per illud 2 ad Corinthios 1 ibi: «Non enim dominamur fidei vestrae, sed adiutores sumus», ubi glossa Ambrosii dicit: «Dominium et coactionem fides non patitur, cum sit voluntatis, non necessitatis. | Also, with regard to what was touched on above, how the power of ruling in the church is not properly constituted in coercion with respect to that root by which it is from God, but in ministerial care, it is proved by that 2 Corinthians 1, where it is said: "For we do not dominate your faith, but we are co-workers." |
| 260 | » Et Chrysostomus in 2 Dialogorum c. | The gloss of Ambrose says: "Domination and coercion faith does not suffer, since it is of the will, not of necessity." |
| 260 | 3 inquit: «In ecclesia vero non coactum, sed acquiescentem oportet ad meliora converti. | And Chrysostom in the second Dialogue says: "In the church, however, it is not by coercion, but by persuasion, that one ought to be converted to better things." |
| 260 | » Et Augustinus super illo 1 ad Timotheum ultimo: «Quicumque sub iugo sunt», dicit: «Sciendum aliquos praedicasse communem omnibus in Christo libertatem esse. | And Augustine on 1 Timothy, last, says: "It is to be known that some have preached that there is a common liberty for all in Christ." |
| 260 | Quod de spirituali libertate utique verum est, non de carnali. | Which is certainly true of spiritual liberty, not of carnal. |
| 260 | » Plura possent adduci; sufficit scire volentem et acquiescentem tantum et non coactum Christo acceptum, quare omnis spiritualis potestas in libertate et non coactione quantum ad ipsam radicem qua a Christo est proprie fundatur. | Many things could be adduced; it suffices to know that one who is willing and consenting, and not coerced, is acceptable to Christ, and therefore all spiritual power is founded properly in liberty and not in coercion with respect to that root by which it is from Christ. |
| 261 | Verum quia ipsa praesidentia principalis ad unitatem propter tollere scisma ordinata exstitit a deo, tunc, nisi in ipso principe ecclesiastico, absque tamen ipso dominio, quo principes eorum dominantur eis, sit coertio aliqua, non potest recte unitas conservari. | But because that principal presidency, ordained for the sake of unity to remove schism, is from God, then unless there is some coercion in the ecclesiastical prince himself, without, however, that dominion by which their princes dominate them, unity cannot be rightly conserved. |
| 261 | Oportet enim membra putrida et pedem abscindi et oculum scandalizantem ab ecclesia erui, si corpus ecclesiae sanum debet conservari. | For it is necessary that rotten members and the foot that offends and the eye that scandalizes be cut off from the church, if the body of the church is to be preserved healthy. |
| 261 | Quare illa coertio non erit, sicut principes dominantur eorum, quia hic dominandi modus est per vim super corporibus et rebus, sed erit coertio per liberam subiectionem omnium vel partis maioris initiata et punitio non nisi ad salutem tendens. | Therefore, that coercion will not be like princes dominate their subjects, because this manner of dominating is by force over bodies and things, but it will be coercion by the free submission of all or of the greater part, and punishment tending only to salvation. |
| 261 | Unde ex hoc Anacletus papa et alii, ut superius continetur, dicunt Christum Petrum principem concurrente apostolorum consensu constituisse. | Hence, on this account, Pope Anacletus and others, as is contained above, say that Christ constituted Peter as prince with the consent of the apostles. |
| 261 | Et sic ex subiectorum electione et consensu radicatur superioris potestas suo modo coactiva in eos. | And thus, the power of the superior, in its manner coercive over those subject to him, is rooted in the election and consent of those subject. |
| 261 | Qui enim prius liberrimi erant eligendo super se praesidem, se ei subiciunt. | For those who were previously entirely free in choosing a president over themselves submit to him. |
| 261 | Unde ex hoc fundamento superius saepe dicitur potestatem coactivam aut principis aut legis ex approbatione subiectorum per se aut ad hoc communi consensu tacito vel expresso constitutum robur habere. | Hence, on this account, it is often said above that coercive power, either of a prince or of a law, has its strength from the approval of those subject, either by itself or for this purpose constituted by common consent, tacit or express. |
| 261 | Sic enim dicitur: «Quamquam omnis potestas desursum» sit, sive coactiva sive oeconomica, regulativa et ordinativa, tamen ad hoc, ut ipsa extrinsece in actum prorumpere possit homines liberos Christianos regulando vel cogendo, tunc recta regula praerequirit subiectionem liberam eorum, cum ipsi ex lege fidei Christianae et naturali iure non artarentur extra terminos libertatis. | For thus it is said: "Although all power is from above," either coercive or economic, regulative and ordaining, yet in order that it may burst forth extrinsecally into act, regulating or coercing free Christian men, then right rule requires beforehand their free submission, since they themselves are not constrained by the law of Christian faith and natural right outside the limits of liberty. |
| 262 | Hoc modo diffusius intendebam deducere omnem praesulatum ecclesiasticum et spiritualem a Christo mediante hominum assensu constitui. | In this way, I more extensively intended to deduce all ecclesiastical and spiritual preeminence as being constituted by Christ through the assent of men. |
| 262 | Illi enim sunt proprie praepositi nostri, qui sic ex subiectorum consensu praeponuntur, ad quorum oboedientiam nos ex praestito consensu obligamur, cum ex hominibus per homines assumpti sint. | For those are truly our superiors who are thus placed in authority by the consent of those subject to them, to whose obedience we are bound by our given consent, since they have been raised up from among men by men. |
| 262 | Verum quod ex hac radice quam veram credo, nisi ex aliquo miraculo vel signo appareret deum quem praesidere velle ante hominum consensum – tunc quidem omnes Christiani necessario oportet divinis praeceptis in omnibus acquiescere – non possit adhuc Romanum pontificem perpetuum principem ecclesiae probari, satis ex hoc manifestum est. | But that from this root, which I believe to be true, unless it were shown by some miracle or sign that God wished to preside over men before their consent—then indeed all Christians ought necessarily to acquiesce in divine precepts in all things—it is quite evident that the Roman pontiff cannot yet be proven to be the perpetual prince of the Church. |
| 262 | Nam non legitur, etiam si Petrus illum principatum omnimodo habuit, propterea Romanum pontificem, eius successorem, aut Antiochenum vel Hierosolymitanum, cum eiusdem sint successores, habuisse aut habere debere ex sacris litteris, nisi concurrant praedicta, scilicet communis ecclesiae consensus, sicut apostolorum in Petro. | For it is not written, even if Peter had that principality in every way, that therefore the Roman pontiff, his successor, or the Antiochene or Hierosolymitan, since they are his successors, had or ought to have it from sacred scripture, unless the aforementioned, namely, the common consent of the Church, like that of the apostles in Peter, concur. |
| 262 | Unde, etsi Romanus pontifex aut ex loco et sede Petri aut principatu civitatis inter ceteros mundi episcopos in primatu, ut praecipuus et honorabilior praeses tantae civitatis et sedens in tanta Petri sede veneraretur, tamen, nisi subiective ex consensu concurreret electivo per eos, qui aliorum omnium vices gerunt, non crederem ipsum praesidem aliorum omnium et principem sive iudicem esse. | Therefore, even if the Roman pontiff were venerated as having the place and seat of Peter, or the principality of the city among the other bishops of the world in primacy, as the principal and more honorable president of such a city and sitting in such a seat of Peter, nevertheless, unless he were subjectively elected by the consent of those who hold the offices of all the others, I would not believe him to be the president of all the others and their prince or judge. |
| 262 | Quare si per possibile Treverensis archiepiscopus per ecclesiam congregatam pro praeside et capite eligeretur, ille proprie plus successor sancti Petri in principatu foret quam Romanus episcopus, licet credendum sit Romanum pontificem sicut locum Petri ita et principatum numquam perditurum. | Therefore, if, by possibility, the Archbishop of Trier were elected by the assembled Church as president and head, he would be a more proper successor of Saint Peter in principality than the Roman bishop, although it is to be believed that the Roman pontiff, like the place of Peter, will never lose the principality. |
| 262 | Non enim successio ex loco arguit successionem in principatu, ut de Antiochia et Hierosolymis dictum est, nec cessaret ille principatus in ecclesia, etiam si Romanae urbis sedes episcopalis deficeret. | For succession from a place does not argue succession in principality, as has been said of Antioch and Jerusalem, nor would that principality cease in the Church, even if the episcopal see of Rome were to fail. |
| 262 | Et de hoc superius tetigi plura. | And I have touched upon this more fully above. |
| 263 | Et quod ecclesia habeat illam potestatem sibi de capite providendi libere patet, quia in omnibus pro sua salute &laddChristo&radd succedit. | And that the Church has that power to provide freely for its head is evident, because in all things it succeeds for its salvation and Christ. |
| 263 | Praelati etiam omnes habentes ligandi et solvendi potestatem, &laddquod&radd missi sunt a Christo sicut Christus a patre, manifestum est ex verbis Christi Ioannis 20: «Sicut misit me pater etc. | Also, that all prelates who have the power to bind and loose, sent by Christ as Christ was by the Father, is evident from the words of Christ in John 20: "As the Father sent me, etc." |
| 263 | », ubi apparet quod, sicut Christus fuit filius dei verus, ita ecclesia, eius corpus mysticum, habet missionem similem a Christo. | Where it appears that, just as Christ was the true Son of God, so the Church, his mystical body, has a similar mission from Christ. |
| 263 | Quare ecclesia sicut Christus habet auctoritatem mittendi. | Therefore, the Church, like Christ, has the authority to send. |
| 264 | Resideo itaque in hac conclusione quod principatus ecclesiasticus ob unitatem ecclesiae et ad eius servitium et ministerium a deo ordinatus in realitate sua a Christo per ecclesiam constituitur. | Therefore, I remain in this conclusion that ecclesiastical principality, for the unity of the Church and for its service and ministry, is ordained by God in its reality to be constituted by Christ through the Church. |
| 264 | Et quaecumque argumenta aut pro ea parte quod principatus coactivus a deo in ecclesia sit tantum, aut ex alia parte quod ipse coactivus principatus ex electione sive consensu hominum seu ecclesiae &laddtantum&radd exsistat, ad hoc medium concordantiae meo iudicio veraciter reducuntur. | And whatever arguments, either that the coercive principality in the Church is only from God, or on the other hand that this coercive principality exists only from the election or consent of men or the Church, are, in my judgment, truly reducible to this middle ground of agreement. |
| 265 | Nihil tamen de meis conceptibus adeo firmum assero, quin peritioribus non dicam potius acquiescendum, dicit enim Ambrosius: «Unumquemque enim fallunt sua scripta et aurem praetereunt atque ut filii deformes etiam delectant; sic etiam scriptorem indecori sermones sui palpant», ut haec Ambrosius Sabino epistula 33 scribit. | However, I do not assert anything so firmly about my conceptions that I do not say that it is rather to be acquiesced to by those more expert; for Ambrose says: "For each one is deceived by his own writings and passes over the ear, and even pleases as deformed children; so too the writer feels the indecorous words of his own," as Ambrose writes in his letter to Sabinus, Epistle 33. |
| 265 | Tamen minus offendere puto ecclesiam hanc opinionem, et per consequens verior censeri debet quam illa Marsilii de Padua in libro Defensorii pacis, cum ipse suam ex fundamento textus sancti Augustini, 9 di. | Nevertheless, I believe this opinion offends the Church less, and consequently it ought to be considered truer than that of Marsilius of Padua in his book Defensor Pacis, since he bases his own on the foundation of the text of St. Augustine, 9th discourse. |
| 265 | Ego solis, tantum possit defendere opinionem, resolvendo solutionem omnium argumentorum in contrarium ad hoc, quod auctoritatibus doctorum credere non artamur, nisi inquantum se in canone Bibliae fundant. | I alone can defend this opinion, resolving the solution of all arguments to the contrary to this, that we are not bound to believe the authorities of the doctors unless insofar as they are founded on the canon of Scripture. |
| 265 | Haec est perniciosa opinio post sanctae ecclesiae approbationem probabilium doctorum. | This is a pernicious opinion after the approval of the Holy Church by probable doctors. |
| 265 | Unde potius etiam acquiescendum est textibus 12 di. | Therefore, it is rather to be acquiesced to the texts of the 12th discourse. |
| 265 | Ecclesiasticarum et aliis ibi positis quam ita praesumere, neque vera est solutio argumentorum Marsilii ex suo fundamento iuxta praemissa, quia loquentes doctores de Petri principatu iuxta praemissa in dictis Christi se fundant quae in canone Bibliae habentur et non in historiis aliis, licet etiam illae non sint negandae de Petro, quoniam sancti eas pro veris habuerunt, ut probat epistula Ambrosii ad Auxentium de basilicis tradendis, epistula 76. | And other texts placed there, than to presume thus, nor is the solution of Marsilius' arguments from his foundation according to the foregoing true, because the doctors speaking of Peter's principality, according to the foregoing, base themselves on the words of Christ contained in the canon of Scripture, and not on other histories, although those also are not to be denied concerning Peter, since the saints held them to be true, as is proved by Ambrose's letter to Auxentius on the handing over of basilicas, Epistle 76. |
| 266 | Et consequenter, quoniam deformitas omnis est ex hoc, quia nec praesidentes sua utuntur potestate ordinate ad finem, propter quem est pastoralis praesidentia, nec subiecti ordinate superioribus, ut status cuiusque deposcit, oboediunt, de regulis canonicis, quomodo talis concordantia per sanctos patres conservabatur, fuit dicendum. | And consequently, since all deformity arises from this, that neither the presidents use their power in an orderly manner for the end for which pastoral presidency is, nor the subjects obey the superiors in an orderly manner as the status of each requires, it was necessary to speak of the canonical rules, how such concord was preserved by the holy fathers. |
| 266 | Quare praemitti oportebat de ipso concilio ecclesiae catholicae, in quo est prima auctoritas ex consensu omnium constituendi et regulandi cuncta ad salutem dirigentia, deinde de aliis particularibus conciliis et post hoc de iam editis canonicis reformatorialibus statutis, ut ad instar doctrinae sanctorum patrum et statutorum sacrorum conciliorum hoc sacrum Basiliense concilium insequens patrum vestigia in institutis procedat. | Therefore, it was necessary to preface the Catholic Church council itself, in which is the first authority by the consent of all to establish and regulate all things directing them to salvation, then the other particular councils, and after this the already issued canonical reformatory statutes, so that this sacred Council of Basel might follow in the footsteps of the fathers in its institutions, like the doctrine of the holy fathers and the statutes of the sacred councils. |
| 267 | Et haec est compendiosa collectio primae et subsequentis partis sub omni correctione, licet confuse et ruditer pro incitamento studiosorum tantum scripturis mandata. | And this is a concise collection of the first and subsequent parts under all correction, although confused and rude, for the encouragement of students, only commanded by the scriptures. |
| 267 | DE CONCORDANTIA CATHOLICA LIBER TERTIUS | BOOK THREE OF THE TREATISE ON CATHOLIC CONCORD |
| 268 | Prooemium. | Preface. |
| 268 | Si quis ab exordio fundamenta nostro proposito non tam utilia quam necessaria investigare curaret, essent petenda illa ipsa principia, in quibus vel Aristotelis, Platonis, Tullii ac aliorum omnium sapientum, dum de ordinatis politicis, oeconomicis aut monarchicis regiminibus scripsere, radices posuerunt. | If anyone, from the beginning, were to take care to investigate the foundations of our proposed matter, not merely useful but necessary, those very principles should be sought in which Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, and all other wise men, while writing about ordered political, economic, or monarchical regimes, laid their roots. |
| 268 | Naturalia quidem iura cunctas humanas considerationes et antecedunt et ad omnia illa principia sunt. | Natural rights indeed precede all human considerations and are the principles of all those things. |
| 268 | Omni autem generi animantium primum a natura tribuitur, ut tueatur se, corpus vitamque, declinet nocitura, acquiratque necessaria, ut Tullius ex hac radice primo De officiis tertio capitulo intentum elicit. | To every kind of living creature, first of all, nature is given, to defend itself, its body and life, to avoid harm, and to acquire necessities, as Cicero, from this root, elicits in the third chapter of the first book of On Duties. |
| 268 | Primum quidem essentiae est ipsum esse. | The first thing of essence is being itself. |
| 268 | Quare ad hoc, ut quaelibet essentia sit, habet connata ad hoc principia, instinctum, appetitum aut rationem. | Therefore, in order for any essence to be, it has innate principles, instinct, appetite, or reason for this. |
| 268 | Ex quo evenit secundum naturarum diversitatem varia esse media propter esse et conservari naturaliter instinctui indita. | From which it follows, according to the diversity of natures, that there are various means for being and for being naturally preserved, which are given to instinct. |
| 268 | Hoc fundamento Aristoteles septimo Politicae finali capitulo conclusit omnem artem et disciplinam pro supplemento naturalium defectuum fore. | From this foundation, Aristotle concluded in the final chapter of the seventh book of Politics that all art and discipline is to be for the supplementation of natural defects. |
| 269 | Homines vero ratione prae cunctis animalibus dotati a principio consodalitatem ac communionem suae conservationi ac etiam fini, propter quem quisque est, multum conferre, immo necessariam rationabili discursu intelligentes, naturali instinctu se univere ac sic cohabitantes villagia urbesque construxere. | But men, endowed with reason above all other animals, from the beginning understood that fellowship and communion greatly contribute to their preservation, and even to the end for which each one is, indeed, necessary by rational discourse, uniting themselves by natural instinct and thus inhabiting villages and cities. |
| 269 | Et nisi homo pacis servandae ob corruptum multorum affectum regulas invenisset, parum unio saluti contulisset. | And unless man had found rules for maintaining peace because of the corrupt affections of many, union would have contributed little to salvation. |
| 269 | Quare civitates, in quibus civium unitas ac leges conservandae unitatis et concordiae communi omnium assensu ac etiam earum omnium custodes potentes, quantum publicae conferebat utilitati, ex hoc consequenter ortum habuerunt. | Therefore, cities, in which the unity of citizens and the laws for preserving unity and concord by the common consent of all, and also their powerful guardians, as much as contributed to public utility, consequently arose from this. |
| 270 | Divina quidem superadmiranda ac omnibus gratiose collata lege apertum est, ut intelligerent homines maxime eorum utilitati consoliditates conferre et deinde ordine tali conservari, ut communi omnium ac saltem sapientum heroicorum consensu aliis ipsis faventibus leges statuerentur. | Indeed, the divine and surpassingly admirable law, graciously given by God for the benefit of all, was clearly set forth so that people might most readily understand how to align themselves with its advantages and subsequently preserve order in such a manner that laws favorable to the common good and at least to the wisdom of the heroic class are established with their own consent. |
| 270 | Quoniam, ut praecedenti collectione praehabitum est, secundum sanctum Cyprianum ex Christi promissione maior pars sacerdotii a vera lege non deficiet, ita pariformiter, dum communi consensu res pro conservatione rei publicae tractantur, maior pars populi, civium aut heroicorum a recta via ac pro tempore utili non deficiet. | As previously noted in the collection, according to Saint Cyprian from Christ's promise, a greater part of the priesthood will not be lacking from the true law; similarly, when matters concerning the public welfare are addressed with general consent, a greater part of the populace will not lack guidance through the right path and at opportune times, if guided by wise counsel rather than impulsive actions. |
| 270 | Alioquin contingeret naturalem appetitum frustrari, ut in pluribus, quod pro inconvenientissimo apud philosophantes habetur. | Otherwise, the natural inclination might be frustrated, as is often lamented by philosophers for its inconvenience. |
| 270 | Videmus enim hominem animal esse politicum et civile et naturaliter ad civilitatem inclinari. | We see that man is a political and civil animal naturally inclined towards civility. |
| 270 | Hinc oportet valentiorem partem pro remanentia politiae esse, ut Aristoteles primo Politicae primo capitulo concludit. | Hence, Aristotle concludes in the first chapter of his Politics, that the stronger part must be preserved for the continuity of the state. |
| 271 | Sed cunctipotens deus stultis et fatuis quandam naturalem servitutem adiunxit, per quam facile credant sapientibus, ut sic ipsorum adiutorio gubernentur et consequantur sui conservationem, ut post Calanum Alexandro scriben<tem> in epistula, quae octava in ordine inter Ambrosianas inseritur, legitur quod scilicet «tamquam agricultura homo imprudens et tamquam vinea homo egens sensu. | But the almighty God has added a certain natural servitude to fools and the foolish, through which the wise, believing easily, are governed and preserved by it themselves, as written  in the letter which is the eighth in order among the Ambrosian epistles, thus: "Just as agriculture governs the foolish man, so does vine cultivation govern the stubborn." |
| 271 | » «Recisa autem vinea fructum affert, semiputata frondescit, neglecta luxuriat. | "However, the pruned vine yields fruit, the slightly trimmed grows lushly, the neglected luxuriates." |
| 272 | Quam materiam elegantissime Ambrosius in immediate praecedenti septima tangens epistula dicit: «A philosophis magno disputationis molimine iactata et fluctuata est quaestio dicentibus, quia omnis sapiens liber, omnis autem insipiens serviat. | On this subject, Ambrose touches upon elegantly in the immediately preceding seventh epistle: "The question debated endlessly by philosophers, whether all the wise are slaves or all the foolish, has been tossed about, for every wise person is a slave to the book, whereas the foolish person is not." |
| 272 | Sed multo hoc prius David dixit qui ait: Stultus sicut luna mutatur. | Yet far earlier, David said: "The fool changes like the moon." |
| 272 | Sapiens enim non metu frangitur, non potestate mutatur, non attollitur prosperis, non tristibus mergitur. | For the wise are not shaken by fear, nor altered by power, nor elevated by prosperity, nor sunk by adversity. |
| 272 | Ubi enim sapientia, ibi virtus animi, ibi constantia et fortitudo. | Where wisdom is, there is the strength of the mind, there constancy and fortitude. |
| 272 | Sapiens enim idem est animo, non minuitur, non augetur rerum mutatione, nec ut parvus fluctuat, ut circumferatur omni vento doctrinae. | For wisdom is the same in the mind, neither diminished nor increased by changes in affairs, nor swayed by every wind of doctrine like a small vessel. |
| 272 | » Et infra: «Noe cum audisset, quia insipienter filius suus Cham riserat nudatum patrem, maledixit ei dicens: Maledictus Cham, servus domesticus erit fratribus suis. | "When Noah heard that his foolish son Ham had mocked his nakedness, he cursed him, saying: 'Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants he shall be to his brothers.'" |
| 272 | Et praeposuit ei fratres eius dominos, qui sapienter patris senectutem honorandam putarunt. | And he appointed his brothers as masters over him, who wisely considered the honor due to his father's old age. |
| 272 | Nonne fons ille disciplinarum omnium Iacob ubertatem disputationis huius omnium pectoribus infudit, qui sapientiae merito praelatus est fratri seniori. | Does not Jacob, through his cunning, have infused wisdom into the hearts of all with this dispute? He is rightly esteemed superior to his elder brother by wisdom. |
| 272 | Denique pater pius, qui cum inter duos filios affectu certaret paterno, sed increparet iudicio – affectus enim necessitudine fertur, meritis autem iudicia formantur – cum divideret alteri gratiam, alteri misericordiam, sapienti gratiam, insipienti misericordiam, quia ad virtutem se propriis viribus erigere non poterat nec spontaneum gressum attollere, benedixit eum, ut serviret fratri suo et esset ipsius servus, ostendens ita deteriorem esse servitute insipientiam, ut remedio eius servitus sit, quia stultus regere se non potest et, nisi moderatorem habeat, praecipitatur propriis voluntatibus. | Finally, the pious father, while contending between two sons due to affection but judging by merit – affection follows kinship, merit determines judgment – bestowing favor on one with grace and mercy on the other, wisdom with grace to the wise brother and folly with mercy to the foolish one, since he could not erect virtue through his own strength nor spontaneously advance, blessed him to serve his brother and become his servant, showing how servitude is worse for folly, and thus service is its remedy, since the foolish cannot govern themselves without a moderator, and are driven by their own desires. |
| 272 | Diligens ergo pater et consulens servum eum fratris sui fecit, ut eius regeretur consilio. | Thus, the loving father and prudent guardian made his brother his servant to govern him with counsel. |
| 272 | Ideo inconsultis populis sapientes quique adhibentur rectores, qui plebeiam insipientiam vigore proprio regant, ut potentiae specie dominentur, quo vel invitos auctoritate potestatis subiciant ad oboedientiam prudentioribus et obsequendis legibus. | Therefore, wise leaders are appointed over unwise peoples, who govern the unwise multitude by the strength of their own power, so that under the guise of authority, even unwilling subjects submit to the wise and obedient laws. |
| 272 | Imposuit ergo insipienti velut indomito iugum, et cui in gladio suo vivendum dixerat, libertatem negavit, ne temeritate laberetur. | He thus imposed a yoke of necessity on the foolish, denying them freedom to avoid rashness. |
| 272 | Praefecit ei fratrem, cuius auctoritate et moderatione subiectus proficeret ad conversionem. | He appointed his brother to oversee him with authority and moderation, so he might progress towards correction. |
| 272 | Et quia servitus habet discretionem – est enim necessitatis infirmior, voluntatis fortior, quia pulchrius est bonum, quod non ex necessitate fit, sed ex voluntate – ideo primo ei iugum imposuit necessitatis, postea benedictionem et voluntariae subiectionis impertivit. | And since servitude has discretion – it is weaker by necessity but stronger by will, for it is nobler to do good willingly than by necessity – he first imposed the yoke of necessity on him, then commanded voluntary submission. |
| 272 | Non ergo natu ra servum facit, sed insipientia, nec manumissio liberum, sed disciplina. | Therefore, slavery is not a natural state but a result of folly, nor freedom merely a release, but a discipline. |
| 272 | Denique Esau liber natus est et servus factus, Ioseph venditus in servitutem est et electus ad potestatem, ut suis emptoribus imperaret. | Likewise, Esau was born free but became a servant, and Joseph, sold into servitude, was elevated to power to command his buyers. |
| 273 | Et postquam eleganter libertatem sapientis Ambrosius ibidem declarat, quomodo stulto tantum lex posita est ac quomodo ob peccatum sub poenis legibus redigitur, subiungit: «Servit ergo peccator formidini, servit cupiditati, servit avaritiae, servit libidini, servit malitiae, servit iracundiae et videtur huiusmodi sibi liber, sed magis servit quasi sub tyrannis positus. | And after elegantly declaring the liberty of the wise in the same epistle, Ambrose adds: "The sinner is enslaved to fear, enslaved to desire, enslaved to avarice, enslaved to lust, enslaved to malice, and enslaved to anger; yet he seems to be free, but rather is enslaved like one under tyrants." |
| 273 | Illi autem liberi sunt, qui legibus vivunt. | Those, however, are free who live by laws. |
| 273 | Lex autem vera sermo rectus. | True law is indeed a straight word. |
| 273 | Lex vera non insculpta tabulis nec aere incisa, sed inscripta mentibus atque infixa sensibus. | True law is not inscribed on tablets of brass nor cut in bronze, but written on hearts and deeply engraved in minds. |
| 273 | Quando sapiens non sub lege, sed ipse sibi lex est opus legis in corde suo continens, naturali stilo sibi et quadam inscriptione formatum. | When a wise person is not governed by law but is law unto themselves, containing the work of law within their heart, they are naturally guided and formed by a certain inscription. |
| 273 | » Haec ille. | "This he says." |
| 274 | Graves has sententias cum aliis notandis valde ille praeclarissimus doctor Ambrosius in eadem et sequenti epistula ponit. | Among other notable points, that eminent teacher Ambrose presents in the same and following epistle these weighty considerations: |
| 274 | Ex quibus hoc unum menti tenendum, quod, licet ex necessitate insipientes, quia se ipsos regere non poterant, servi sapientum effecti sunt, tamen alligabatur illi necessitati voluntaria subiectio propter ipsam necessitatem. | Among which this must be held: although by necessity unwise men became servants of the wise to govern themselves, their submission was voluntary due to necessity. |
| 275 | Et sic naturali quodam instinctu praesidentia sapientum et subiectio insipientum redacta ad concordiam exsistit per communes leges, quarum ipsi sapientes maxime auctores, conservatores et executores exsistunt, aliorum omnium ad hoc per voluntariam subiectionem concurrente assensu. | Thus, by a natural instinct, wisdom and the submission of folly are harmonized through common laws, with the wise predominantly as their authors, preservers, and executors, while others join with voluntary assent. |
| 275 | Et regimen dum ita disponitur, tunc «impossibile est civitatem aristocratizantem, id est secundum virtutem» per sapientiores aliorum consensu ad communem utilitatem «gubernatam, non bene disponi», ut Aristoteli placet quarto Politicae capitulo septimo. | And when governance is thus arranged, it becomes impossible for an aristocracy, that is, rule according to virtue, to be guided for the common good by the consensus of the wise, as Aristotle pleases in the seventh chapter of his fourth Politics. |
| 276 | Legis autem latio per eos omnes, qui per eam stringi debent, aut maiorem partem aliorum electione fieri debet, quoniam ad commune conferre debet, et quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus approbari debet, et communis diffinitio ex omnium consensu aut maioris partis solum elicitur. | The scope of law must extend to and be shaped by the majority consensus of those whom it binds, or by their election, since it should benefit all and be approved by all who are affected, with its true definition derived only from universal consent or the greater part. |
| 276 | Nec potest excusatio de oboedientia legum sibi tunc locum vindicare, quando quisque sibi ipsi legem condidit. | No excuse for disobedience to laws can then be valid when each person has established their own law. |
| 276 | «Non est enim bona dispositio bene leges poni, non oboedire autem», ut dicit Aristoteles quarto Politicorum capitulo septimo. | "For indeed, good governance does not consist in laws being well placed without obedience," as Aristotle states in the seventh chapter of his fourth Politics. |
| 276 | Est itaque etiam eorum interpretari, quorum condere. | Therefore, it also pertains to interpret those who have established these laws. |
| 276 | Hiis enim legibus regnum gubernari necesse est, amare enim et odire omnibus insunt. | For by these laws, the kingdom must be governed, as love and hatred are inherent to all. |
| 277 | Quare etiam melius pro re publica exstitit legibus quam optimo viro regi, ut ex intentione tertio Politicae nono capitulo hoc Aristoteles perquirens concludit, ac primo Rhetoricae capitulo primo. | Thus, it was better for the commonwealth to be governed by laws than by an excellent single ruler, as Aristotle concludes in the third intention of the ninth chapter of his Politics and the first chapter of his Rhetoric, inquiring thus: |
| 277 | Ubi enim non principantur leges, ibi non est politia, ut quarto Politicae quarto capitulo. | Where laws do not originate, there is no polity, as stated in the fourth chapter of Politics. |
| 277 | Statui autem oportet leges cum gravitate magna ac digeste multum per prudentiam longa experientia suffultam, ut secundo Politicae secundo capitulo dicitur. | Laws must indeed be established with great gravity and thoroughness through long experience suffused with prudence, as the second chapter of Politics dictates. |
| 278 | Oportet deinde principantes esse pro legum observatione, quos primo secundum ipsas leges dominari oportet, tertio Politicae capitulo sexto et quarto Ethicorum capitulo quinto, quoniam lex «oculus ex multis oculis» et est «intellectus sine appetitu», ut tertio Politicae nono capitulo. | Next, those who initiate must first submit to the laws themselves, commanding according to them as the sixth and fourth chapters of Politics and the fifth chapter of Ethics prescribe, for law is "the eye of many eyes" and an "understanding without desire," as stated in the ninth chapter of Politics. |
| 278 | Inventum enim sic a pluribus, cui iam se quisque subiecit, mutare principantes non debent. | Found thus by the consensus of many to whom it has been submitted, those who initiate should not change. |
| 279 | Et quamquam secundum leges princeps dominari debeat, tamen, quia de hiis est dominus, de quibus secundum leges nihil dicitur certitudinaliter, ut tertio Politicae capitulo sexto, ideo oportet eum esse prudentem, ut tertio Politicae capitulo secundo et quarto Ethicorum tractatu de iustitia, ut epikeizare recte valeat per directionem legis, ubi deficit propter particulare. | And although a prince should rule according to the laws, nonetheless, since he is the lord of those things of which nothing is said with certainty according to the laws, as in the third chapter of the Politics, therefore he must be prudent, as in the second and fourth chapters of the Ethics, so that he may be able to direct things rightly according to the direction of the law, where it is lacking due to particular circumstances. |
| 279 | Et tunc ipse omnis principatus, sive monarchicus per unum, sive aristocraticus plurium sapientum, sive politicus omnium simul et cuiuslibet secundum suum gradum, quando secundum voluntatem subiectorum exsistit ad communem tendens utilitatem, temperatus et iustus dicitur, ut haec per Aristotelem tertio et quarto Politicorum. | And then the very government, whether monarchical through one, or aristocratic through many wise men, or political through all and each according to their own degree, when it exists according to the will of the subjects tending towards common utility, is called temperate and just, as Aristotle says in the third and fourth chapters of the Politics. |
| 279 | Si autem praeter voluntatem subiectorum ad propriam tendens utilitatem principatus exsistit, intemperatus exsistit, ut tertio Politicorum capitulo quinto. | But if the government exists beyond the will of the subjects tending towards its own utility, it is called intemperate, as in the fifth chapter of the Politics. |
| 279 | Et sic exoriuntur tria genera principantium praefatis temperatis adversa ut tyrannides, oligarchia et democratia. | And thus three kinds of governments opposed to the aforementioned temperate ones arise, namely tyrannies, oligarchies, and democracies. |
| 279 | Et de hiis intemperatis tyrannicis, oligarchicis et democraticis prin cipatibus libri historiarum pleni sunt. | And of these intemperate governments, tyrannical, oligarchic, and democratic, the books of histories are full. |
| 280 | Nemroth enim coepit robustus venator esse primo post diluvium, ac Ninus, Assyriorum primus rex, Beli filius, qui primus arma foris extulit libidinis dominandi causa, et post eum Semiramis, eius uxor, quae Trebetam, privignum Nini ex alia Chaldaea uxore filium, patria regnoque expulit, ut ferunt historiae, ob causam quia ipsa in eius exarsit amore quam, quia vitrica eius, iuste sprevit. | For Nemroth began to be a robust hunter first after the flood, and Ninus, the first king of the Assyrians, the son of Bel, who first brought forth arms for the sake of the domination of lust, and after him Semiramis, his wife, who expelled Trebetam, the nephew of Ninus from another Chaldean wife, a son, from his father's kingdom and country, as the histories tell, on account of the reason that she was inflamed with love for him, and justly despised him. |
| 280 | Ipsa eum insequente Europam adiit ac demum locum mansivum campo quodam amoenissimo interluente eum Mosella, de quo Ausonius admirandum huius fluvii nominis opus metro contexit, delegit ac nostram ibi sui nominis urbem condidit Trebericam, omnium quae in Europa sunt primam, anno 42. | She herself followed him into Europe and at last settled in a most beautiful place between the Moselle, of which Ausonius wove an admirable work in verse, and chose to found there our city bearing her name, Treberica, the first of all those in Europe, in the year 42, at the birth of Abraham, as the old histories say. |
| 280 | nativitatis Abrahae, ut veteres dicunt historiae. | But these things are beside the point. |
| 280 | Sed haec praeter propositum. | For temperate governments, how the very Moses and Aaron and Eleazar and the first kings in the Roman republic, then the senate and consuls, and even the emperors, were constituted with the consent and will of the common utility, it would be superfluous to narrate this clearly to all in this place. |
| 281 | De temperatis quidem principatibus, quomodo ipse Moyses et Aaron ac Eleazar ac in Romana re publica reges primo, deinde senatus ac consules et etiam imperatores consensu et voluntate pro communi utilitate constituti sunt, supervacuum foret hoc loco notissima omnibus enarrare. | But it is necessary for the ruler to be one for many reasons, even if the government were united and compacted from many heroic men. |
| 282 | Oportet autem principantem unum esse multis ex causis, etiam si ipse principatus ex pluribus heroicis viris unitus et compactus foret. | Otherwise, confusion would arise, when many would contend in the government, and the order would be confused, when the subjects would not know to whom to obey. |
| 282 | Alioquin confusio exoriretur, quando in principando plures concurrerent, et confunderetur ordo, quando subiecti cui oboedire nescirent. | Therefore, the plurality of princes is evil, because one must be the ruler, to whom one may recur securely in the end. |
| 282 | Pluralitas igitur principum mala, quoniam unum oportet principantem esse, ad quem ultimo secure recurratur. | But any monarchic or aristocratic government, when it is constituted with willing subjects, must be established by election, as in the eighth chapter of the Politics. |
| 282 | Omnem autem principatum monarchicum vel aristocraticum, cum volentibus subditis constituantur illi principatus, electione constitui oportet, tertio Politicae capitulo octavo. | Among all the temperate kinds of governments, the monarchical one excels. |
| 283 | Inter autem omnia temperati principatus genera monarchicus praeeminet. | Among the species of this temperate monarchical government, which is established by election without successors, the one that is established by election with its own successors is preferred. |
| 283 | Inter autem species huius principatus temperati monarchicus, qui per electionem constituitur absque successoribus, praefertur ei, qui per electionem constituitur cum ipsis successoribus. | For in the succession of the kind, various things often intervene, which often harm the republic. |
| 283 | In generis enim successione varia solent intervenire, quae rei publicae saepe obsunt. | Although heroic and wise and noble men are often elected for a long time to the monarchical regime, yet because they contract the nature of their children in succession, as the sons of fertile land, and they degenerate successively, and finally the glory of their fathers perishes, as Aristotle says in the twenty-fourth chapter of the second book of Rhetoric. |
| 283 | Quamquam enim heroici et sapientissimi et nobilissimi viri saepe cum posteris ad monarchicum regimen legantur salubriter aliquamdiu electi, tamen quia ad instar fertilis agri filii talium primi naturam parentum contrahentes successive degenerant, et demum perit illorum illustritas, ut Aristoteles hoc habet secundo Rhetoricae capitulo vicesimo quarto. | Wherefore, although many and strong reasons exist for the succession of the monarchical regime, nonetheless, as the best of all, who confers the common good, always presides over the republic, there is no better way of establishing it than by a new election of all or the greater part, or at least of those leaders, who have the vices of all by consent. |
| 283 | Unde etsi multae etiam rationes praegnantes et fortes pro successorio monarchatu exsistant, nihilominus ut optimus omnium voluntate ad commune conferens praesit rei publicae semper, non est melior quisquam statuendi modus quam per novam electionem omnium aut maioris partis vel saltem eorum procerum, qui omnium vices ex consensu habent. | This seems to be the opinion of Aristotle in the ninth chapter of the first book of Politics, and the eighth chapter of the second book, and the second chapter of the third book, and the ninth chapter of the seventh book, and the twelfth chapter. |
| 284 | Haec videtur Aristotelis sententia primo Politicae capitulo nono et libro secundo capitulo octavo et tertio capitulo secundo et septimo libro capitulo nono et duodecimo. | But the duty of the ruler is to presume nothing against the laws, but rather to be subject to them, and their doctrine, like the heart in the middle of the body, must vivify the whole republic, and it must be punished according to the same laws in difficult cases, which generate scandal in the republic by transgression, although not in small crimes, lest the rule become contemptible. |
| 284 | Huius vero officium est nihil contra leges praesumere, immo subesse debet eis et earum doctrina tamquam cor in medio corporis totam rem publicam vivificare, immo secundum easdem puniri debet in arduis scandalum in re publica ex transgressione generantibus, licet non in parvis delictis, ne contemptibilis fiat principatus. | Therefore, the ruler must watch over the republic, like the heart, continuously, and with the strictest observance of the laws, which he must execute, as it is said in the sixth chapter of the seventh book of Politics, and not with the utmost power, so that the kingdom may last longer, as Aristotle declares in the fifth book of Politics about Theopompos, who wanted to make his kingdom last longer. |
| 284 | Vigilare itaque princeps habet ad instar cordis continue pro re publica et legum strictissima observantia, quas eum exequi oportet, ut dicitur septimo Politicae capitulo sexto, et non uti summa potestate, ut regnum diuturnius fiat, ut Aristoteles quinto Politicorum de Theopompo declarat, qui voluit facere suum regnum diuturnum. | Therefore, supreme power is rarely used, so that he may conform to the laws and preserve the love of the people. |
| 284 | Ideo suprema potestate raro usus est, ut se legibus conformaret et populi amorem conservaret. | For there are three things necessary for the ruler: first, love for consistent politics, second, the power of great works of the government, third, to rule with virtue and justice, as in the fourth chapter of the fifth book of Politics. |
| 285 | Sunt enim principanti necessaria tria: Primo amor ad consistentem politiam, secundo potentia maximorum operum principatus, tertio dominare cum virtute et iustitia, ut quinto Politicae capitulo quarto. | But virtue itself is prudence, which is the mistress of virtues, as in the final chapter of the sixth book of Ethics. |
| 285 | Virtus autem est ipsa prudentia, quae est virtutum magistra, sexto Ethicorum capitulo finali. | But power is necessary, so that he may be able to execute the civil judgments on rebels by coercive power. |
| 285 | Potentia autem necessaria est, ut per coactivam potentiam civiles sententias in rebelles exsequi possit. | Wherefore, he must have an instrument suitable for this, namely an army of armed men. |
| 285 | Unde oportet ad hoc aptum habere instrumentum, scilicet exercitum armatorum. | For Aristotle says in the sixth chapter of the seventh book of Politics: "But it is necessary for them to have arms for the sake of the government of those who are unwilling," and it must be such that it is greater, "than the sum of the individual and one, and the sum of the many, but less than the multitude," as in the ninth chapter of the third book of Politics. |
| 285 | Dicit enim Aristoteles septimo Politicae sexto capitulo: «Communicantes autem necessarium est ipsis arma habere ad principatum inoboe dientium gratia», et ilia esse debet tanta, «ut sit ea, quae singulorum et unius et simul plurium, maior, ea autem, quae multitudinis, minor», ut tertio Politicorum nono capitulo. | The army must be moderate, lest it seem that the monarch wants to tyrannize for his own utility, and yet powerful for some and many rebels. |
| 285 | Mediocris quidem debet esse exercitus, ne videatur monarcham tyrannizare velle ad propriam utilitatem, et tamen potens pro aliquibus et pluribus rebellibus. | But any punishment that the ruler must inflict must be compared to the medicinal antidote of the republic, as Aristotle teaches in the third chapter of the third book of Ethics, and he must pay great attention, lest great inequality arise in the subjects. |
| 286 | Omnem autem poenam, quam principans infligere debet, comparare debet medicinali antidoto rei publicae, ut docet Aristoteles tertio Ethicorum tertio capitulo, et summopere ad hoc advertere, ne in subiectis magna oriatur inaequalitas. | For the growth of some, when the proportion is broken, causes the republic to perish. |
| 286 | Propter enim excrescentiam aliquorum rupta proportione politia perit. | "For as the body is composed of parts, and it is necessary to augment proportionally, so that health and commensurability may remain, otherwise it is corrupted, if it grows not according to the quantity, but according to the quality," as Aristotle says in the second and third chapters of the seventh book of Politics. |
| 286 | «Sicut enim ex partibus corpus componitur, et oportet augeri proportionabiliter, ut» sanitas et «commensuratio maneat, alias corrumpitur, si non secundum quantum, sed secundum quale crescit», ut haec Aristoteles quinto Politicorum in secundo et tertio eiusdem capitulo septimo declarat. | Therefore, the ruler must be skilled in many things, with prudence and experience of things, so that he may be able to succor the ailing republic with medicinal penalties, according to the time and place, now in one way, now in another, as the quality of time demands, as the elegant example of Aurelius Augustinus teaches to Volusianus about the change of divine laws, saying that the experienced physician Vindicianus cured a young man from a certain infirmity with a certain medicinal remedy known to the young man. |
| 287 | Multa itaque circumspectione, prudentia ac rerum experientia pollere principantem necesse est, ut secundum tempus et locum utiliter per poenas medicinales aegrotanti rei publicae – aliter nunc, aliter tunc, ut temporis qualitas deposcit – salubriter succurrat, ut eleganti exemplo Aurelius Augustinus ad Volusianum de divinarum legum mutatione nos informat dicens Vindicianum medicum expertissimum adolescentem a quadam infirmitate mediante certa medicinali re adolescenti nota curasse. | After some time, the young man grew old and fell into the same disease. |
| 287 | Post tempora senuit adolescens et in eandem reincidit pestem. | He used the same remedy, which had previously restored him to health, and he did not recover. |
| 287 | Usus est proprio motu eadem re, quae prius eum sanitati restituit, nec convaluit. | He consulted Vindicianus about the cause. |
| 287 | Causam a Vindiciano exquirit. | He replied elegantly: "It did not profit, because Vindicianus did not give it." |
| 287 | Respondit eleganter: Non profuit, quia Vindicianus non porrexit. | Asked afterwards, why he had assigned this cause of the invalidity of the medicine, he said: "I said rightly." |
| 287 | Interrogatus post, cur hanc causam invaliditatis medicinae confinxisset, dixit: Recte dixi. | Asked again, why he had said this, he said: "Because I would not have given it to a man of mature age, who was once a young man." |
| 287 | Si dedissem, profuisset. | This example instructs that changes, both in divine and human laws, are made usefully at the right time for the same end, as Augustinus teaches in the dialogue with Volusianus. |
| 287 | Non autem dedissem modo maturioris aetatis viro quam quondam adolescenti. | Therefore, the ruler must be accustomed to change the laws, not according to his own will, but according to the common utility, and he must be willing to give up his own power, as the example of Vindicianus shows. |
| 287 | Hoc exemplo Augustinus instruit mutationes tam in divinis quam humanis legibus utiliter pro tempore per eundem ac ad eundem finem fieri. | For he would have profited, if he had given it, but he did not give it, because he was a man of mature age, who was once a young man. |
| 288 | Venerabilis Sedulius in libello De Christianis rectoribus decimo capitulo octavo principaliter regi necessaria hiis metris exprimit: Fabrica nulla tenet stabilem per tempora formam, Si non fulturis nixa sit illa suis, Nec stabilire queunt splendentia lumine templa, Aula nec et regum hiis sine firma potest. | The venerable Sedulius, in his book *On Christian Rulers*, chapter ten, section eight, principally expresses what is necessary for a king in these verses: "No structure maintains a stable form through time, if it is not supported by its own buttresses; nor can temples shining with bright light, nor the hall and kingdom, stand without firm foundations." |
| 288 | Iusti rectoris propriis sic stare columnis Publica res poscit propitiante deo. | It is required by the public good that a just ruler stand firm on his own pillars, with God's favor. |
| 288 | Prima columna micat veri speciosa decore, Ac patiens regimen rite secunda tenet. | The first pillar shines with the beautiful adornment of truth, and the second dutifully upholds the government. |
| 288 | Tertia largiflua meritis dat munera dextra, Quartaque blandiloquax dulcia verba sonat. | The third, bountiful in merit, bestows gifts with its right hand, and the fourth, eloquent, utters sweet words. |
| 288 | Quinta malos reprimit miro zeloque coruscat, Gaudet sexta potens magnificare bonos. | The fifth represses the wicked with wondrous zeal and shines brightly, and the sixth, powerful, rejoices in magnifying the good. |
| 288 | Septima clementer populi levigatque tributum, Ast octava regit iustitiae trutinam. | The seventh gently alleviates the people's tribute, while the eighth governs the scales of justice. |
| 288 | Nititur hiis solidis res publica fulta columnis Sicuti mons Sion, hiis stabilisque manet. | The republic, supported by these solid pillars, stands firm like Mount Zion, and remains stable. |
| 289 | Possent plura et elegantissima dicta sapientum huc adduci, si nostri propositi foret de ipsis principantibus ad longum tractare. | Many more elegant sayings of the wise could be adduced here, if it were the purpose of our undertaking to treat at length of those who hold power. |
| 289 | Sed haec radix nobis ad omnia cum hiis praemissis sufficit, quod quemlibet principantem inter Christi fideles se oportet Christo, cuius figuram et successionem gestat, in typo conformare. | But this root, along with what has been said before, suffices for us in all things: that every ruler among the faithful of Christ ought to conform himself in type to Christ, whose image and succession he bears. |
| 289 | Respiciat itaque ad Christum, qui est ipsa veritas. | Therefore, let him look to Christ, who is truth itself. |
| 289 | Et primo consideret, quoniam ipse est dominus et magister, deus et homo, ita et omnis principatus ex quodam divino et humano exsurg it. | And first, let him consider that since he himself is lord and master, God and man, so too all principality arises from a certain divine and human source. |
| 289 | Potestas enim omnis dei habet ordinationem, ad Romanos 13. | For all authority is from God, Romans 13. |
| 289 | Et Augustinus super illo Ioannis 19: «Non haberes potestatem adversus me ullam, nisi tibi datum esset desuper», eleganter declarat potestatem etiam Pilati in Christum a deo fuisse. | And Augustine, commenting on John 19: "You would have no power at all against me, unless it had been given you from above," elegantly declares that Pilate's power over Christ also came from God. |
| 290 | Sic et sanctus Bernardus ad archiepiscopum Senonensem scribens dicit: «Romani praesidis potestatem Christus supra se fatetur caelitus ordinatam. | So also Saint Bernard, writing to the Archbishop of Sens, says: "Christ acknowledges the power of the Roman prefect as divinely ordained. |
| 290 | » Quare sacra est omnis maiestas et spiritualis et a deo. | Therefore, all majesty, both spiritual and temporal, is sacred and from God. |
| 290 | Est etiam ab homine, ut Christus verus virginis Mariae filius. | It is also from man, as Christ is the true son of the Virgin Mary. |
| 290 | Unde ex incorrupta et intemerata Virgine eius liberali consensu interveniente, dum diceret: «Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum», Christus nascitur, deus et homo. | Therefore, from the incorrupt and undefiled Virgin, with her free consent intervening, when she said, "Let it be done to me according to your word," Christ was born, God and man. |
| 290 | Ad instar huius ex unica incorrupta ecclesia sive congregatione hominum ex purissimo consensu prodire debet verus principatus, non ex aliqua violentia, non ex ambitione aut pravitate simoniaca, sed ex puritate, qua Christus in mundum per amorem salutis populi dignatus est venire. | In the likeness of this, true principality ought to proceed from a single, incorrupt church or congregation of men, from the purest consent, not from any violence, not from ambition or simoniacal wickedness, but from purity, through which Christ deigned to come into the world for the love of the salvation of the people. |
| 290 | Et dum sic per Christum, qui est ostium verum, ad principatum quis eligitur et vocatur et secundum Christi exemplum cum humilitate acceptatur et per vestigia Christi princeps ambulaverit, necesse est rem publicam optime disponi et imperantis nomen perennari. | And when someone is thus chosen and called to principality through Christ, who is the true door, and is accepted with humility according to Christ's example, and the prince walks in the footsteps of Christ, it is necessary that the republic be best ordered and the name of the ruler endure. |
| 290 | Christus enim sub lege erat, non venit solvere legem, sed adimplere, humilis et mitis corde, medicus mansuetissimus. | For Christ was under the law; he came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it, humble and meek of heart, the most gentle physician. |
| 290 | Et non est opus alia quacumque doctrina principanti quam eius vestigia insequi, quoniam tunc in luce veritatis ambulat et vitam aeternam consequetur. | And there is no need for any other doctrine for a ruler than to follow his footsteps, for then he walks in the light of truth and will attain eternal life. |
| 291 | Et quia principalis nostra intentio in hoc opere versatur circa inquisitionem concordantiae catholicae, ideo haec nunc sufficiant. | And because our principal intention in this work is concerned with the investigation of Catholic concordance, therefore these things now suffice. |
| 291 | In ipso principali proposito insistentes investigemus ad hoc consequenter opportuna. | Insisting on this principal purpose, let us investigate what is consequently opportune for this. |
| 292 | Capitulum I. | Chapter I. |
| 292 | Satis praecedens collectio concordiam ecclesiasticae dispositioni vim maximam dare ac dubia magna exsolvit interque ea, quae memoriae digna commendavit, hoc notavit. | The preceding collection sufficiently gives the greatest force to the concord of ecclesiastical arrangement and resolves great doubts; and among those things which it commended to memory, it noted this. |
| 292 | Praecipue ecclesiam Christi ex sacramentis, sacerdotio fidelibusque connexam, in qua unitate sacramenta ut spiritus, sacerdotium ut anima ac ceteri fideles ut corpus ad unius Christi mysticum corpus compositionem concorditer constringuntur. | Especially the Church of Christ, connected by sacraments, priesthood, and the faithful, in which unity the sacraments are as the spirit, the priesthood as the soul, and the other faithful as the body, are concordantly bound together for the composition of the mystical body of the one Christ. |
| 292 | Verum de sacerdotio quaedam praemissa sunt. | However, certain things have been premised concerning the priesthood. |
| 292 | De corpore quidem, quantum proposito congruit, sermo habendus nunc est, cuius gradualis hierarchica ordinatio in unum omnium principem ab infimo simplicium laicorum pedum typum gerentium per rectores, comites, marchiones, duces et reges usque in caesareum caput ex superioribus facile quisquam intelligere poterit. | Now, a discussion must be had concerning the body, as far as it is fitting to the purpose, whose gradual hierarchical ordering from the lowest type of simple laymen bearing the burden to rulers, counts, marquises, dukes, and kings, up to the imperial head, anyone can easily understand from the foregoing. |
| 293 | Omnia enim, quae a deo sunt, ordinata necessario sunt. | For all things which are from God are necessarily ordered. |
| 293 | Est itaque in catholica ecclesia in hoc ordine unus in plenitudine potestatis ceteris supereminens mundi dominus, qui Romano pontifici suo modo in hac corporali hierarchia ad instar ipse in sacerdotali regulariter par esse dicitur servata differentia, quae inter spirituale et corporale exsistit. | Therefore, in the Catholic Church, in this order, there is one who surpasses all others in the fullness of power, the lord of the world, who is said to be in a way equal to the Roman Pontiff in this corporeal hierarchy, in the same way as he himself is regularly in the priestly hierarchy, the difference which exists between the spiritual and the corporeal being preserved. |
| 293 | Quas quidem sui generis concordantias utriusque potestatis ac etiam differentias investigare particulariter non intendo, sed ad praescripta hac regula investigantem remitto, ut cognoscat imperialem maiestatem ita omnium de iure, qui imperio subsunt, potestatem habere, sicut Romanus patriarcha subiectos episcopos Romanae ecclesiae in potestate habet. | I do not intend to investigate these concordances and differences of each power in particular, but I refer the investigator to this prescribed rule, that he may know that the imperial majesty has the power over all those who are subject to the empire by right, just as the Roman Patriarch has the bishops subject to the Roman Church in his power. |
| 293 | Et sicut inter cunctos patriarchas Romanus est primus, ita inter cunctos reges Romanorum rex. | And just as among all patriarchs the Roman is first, so among all kings the Roman king. |
| 293 | Duces vero archiepiscopis, comites episcopis compara et prosequere residuum, ut superius secundum Leonem IX. | Compare dukes to archbishops, counts to bishops, and continue the rest, as is contained in Leo IX in a certain place. |
| 293 | quodam loco continetur. | which is contained in a certain place. |
| 294 | Capitulum II. | Chapter II. |
| 294 | Esset in primis stabiliendum fundamentum, quomodo ipsum imperium sacrum a deo sit. | In the first place, the foundation should be established, how the very sacred empire is from God. |
| 294 | Deinde, an dependeat ab eodem immediate. | Then, whether it depends immediately on the same. |
| 294 | Post haec, ubi hodie exsistat, et an a papa sit translatum in veritate de Graecis in Germanos in persona Caroli Magni, ac de electoribus imperii, qua utantur potestate. | After these things, where it exists today, and whether it was transferred from the Pope in truth from the Greeks to the Germans in the person of Charlemagne, and concerning the electors of the empire, what power they use. |
| 294 | Et quoniam istae quaestiones varie ac prolixe per multos modernos doctores habentur, delegi tacendum esse. | And because these questions are variously and at length treated by many modern doctors, I have chosen to remain silent. |
| 294 | Unum vero praeterire nequeo, quoniam paene omnium sententia indubitata est Constantinum imperatorem occidentis imperium Romano pontifici Silvestro ac suis in aevum successoribus perpetuo dono tradidisse et ideo, etiam si ratio de unitate principantis, scilicet adversari bono et recto ordini duo capita fore, non concluderet, pateret tamen in occidente imperatorem nullum, nisi a papa dependenter imperium cognosceret, iuste esse posse. | However, I cannot pass over one thing, because it is almost the undisputed opinion of all that the Emperor Constantine handed over the empire of the West to the Roman Pontiff Sylvester and his successors forever as a perpetual gift; and therefore, even if the argument concerning the unity of the ruler, namely, that to have two heads would be contrary to good and right order, did not conclude, it would nevertheless be clear that in the West no emperor could justly exist unless he acknowledged the empire as dependent on the Pope. |
| 295 | Hanc radicem, quoad potui, investigavi praesupponens hoc etiam indubitatum esse Constantinum talem donationem facere potuisse, quae tamen quaestio nec soluta hactenus nec solvetur verisimiliter umquam. | I have investigated this root as best I could, presupposing this also to be undisputed, that Constantine could make such a donation, which question, however, has not yet been solved and will probably never be solved. |
| 295 | Sed in veritate supra modum admiror, si res ita est, eo quod in authenticis libris et historiis approbatis non invenitur. | But in truth I am exceedingly amazed if this is so, because it is not found in authentic books and approved histories. |
| 295 | Relegi omnes, quas potui, historias, gesta imperialia ac Romanorum pontificum, historias sancti Hieronymi, qui ad cuncta colligendum diligentissimus fuit, Augustini, Ambrosii ac aliorum opuscula peritissimorum, revolvi gesta sacrorum conciliorum, quae post Nicaenum fuere, et nullam invenio concordantiam ad ea, quae de illa donatione leguntur. | I have reviewed all the histories I could, the imperial and Roman pontifical acts, the histories of Saint Jerome, who was most diligent in collecting everything, the works of Augustine, Ambrose, and other most skilled men, I have reviewed the acts of the sacred councils which were after Nicaea, and I find no concordance with those things which are read concerning that donation. |
| 296 | Sanctus Damasus papa ad instantiam beati Hieronymi actus et gesta praedecessorum dicitur annotasse, in cuius opere de Silvestro papa non ea inveniuntur, quae vulgo dicuntur. | Pope Saint Damasus, at the urging of blessed Jerome, is said to have annotated the acts and deeds of his predecessors, in whose work on Pope Silvester, those things that are commonly said are not found. |
| 296 | Legitur in certis historiis Constantinum a Silvestro baptizatum et ipsum imperatorem tres illas sancti Joannis, sanctorum Petri et Pauli ecclesias mirifice ornasse ac annuos multos redditus e diversis massis terrarum in diversis provinciis et insulis pro continuando ornatum lampadarum, balsami et nardipistici ac cereorum donasse, de quibus omnibus particularem mentionem in pontificum libro reperies. | It is read in certain histories that Constantine was baptized by Silvester and that he, the emperor, wonderfully adorned the three churches of Saint John, Saints Peter and Paul, and donated many annual revenues from various masses of land in various provinces and islands for the continuation of the ornamentation of lamps, balm, and nard, and wax, about all of which a particular mention is found in the book of the pontiffs. |
| 296 | Sed de donatione temporalis dominii aut imperii occidentis nihil ibi penitus continetur. | But concerning the donation of temporal dominion or empire of the West, nothing is contained therein at all. |
| 296 | Verum quod, postquam Aistulfus rex Langobardorum Exarchatum Ravennatem occupavit cum aliis multis locis et Stephanus II. | Truly, after Aistulf, king of the Lombards, occupied the Exarchate of Ravenna with many other places, and Stephen II, a Roman by nation, from his father Constantine, sent many legates to Aistulf, asking him to restore the places to imperial rule, and Aistulf was unwilling to do so. |
| 296 | natione Romanus ex patre Constantino multis legatis ad Aistulfum missis rogaret imperiali ditioni loca restitui et facere non vellet Aistulfus, Stephanus Pippinum adiens eum cum duobus filiis in reges unxit. | Stephen, approaching Pippin with his two sons, anointed them as kings. |
| 296 | Fuit et cum eodem Stephano missus imperatoris, et a Pippino impetrarunt, ut Aistulfum induceret, quod imperio loca restitueret. | There was also a messenger of the emperor sent with the same Stephen, and they obtained from Pippin that he would induce Aistulf to restore the places to the empire. |
| 296 | Misit Pippinus nec impetravit. | Pippin sent, but did not obtain. |
| 296 | Unde cum non posset sic ab Aistulfo restitutionem impetrare, promisit Stephano se vi ablaturum ab eo et sancto Petro daturum. | Whence, since he could not thus obtain restitution from Aistulf, he promised Stephen that he would take it away from him by force and give it to Saint Peter. |
| 296 | Hoc audito revertitur imperialis missus. | The imperial messenger returned upon hearing this. |
| 296 | Pippinus quae promiserat explevit. | Pippin fulfilled what he had promised. |
| 296 | Forma vero huius donationis in gestis praefati Stephani cum nominatione particulari omnium locorum continetur. | The form of this donation is contained in the deeds of the aforementioned Stephen, with a particular nomination of all the places. |
| 297 | Zacharias papa monarchiam regni Franciae in Pippinum transtulit Ludovico rege deposito, de quo legitur 15 q. | Pope Zacharias transferred the monarchy of the kingdom of France to Pippin, deposing King Louis, about which it is read in 15 q. |
| 297 | 6 Alius et in glossa c. | Another in the gloss on c. |
| 297 | Venerabilem. | Venerable. |
| 297 | Ex illo puto Pippinum sedi apostolicae favisse. | From that, I think Pippin favored the apostolic see. |
| 297 | Post hoc Desiderius rex iterum illas civitates aut aliquas tempore Hadriani vi cepit. | After this, Desiderius, king of the Lombards, again seized those cities or some of them by force in the time of Hadrian. |
| 297 | Hadrianus papa multis missis ad eum legatis repetiit ius sancti Petri, impetrare non potuit. | Hadrian, the pope, sent many legates to him, repeating the right of Saint Peter, but he could not obtain it. |
| 297 | Tunc Carolus Magnus invocatus per Hadrianum recuperavit et iterum donavit sancto Petro solempni donatione, quae in gestis eiusdem Hadriani papae continetur. | Then Charles the Great, invoked by Hadrian, recovered and again donated to Saint Peter with a solemn donation, which is contained in the deeds of the same Pope Hadrian. |
| 297 | Ex istis constat Constantinum imperium per Exarchatum Ravennatem, urbem Romam et occidentem minime papae dedisse. | From these things, it is clear that Constantine did not give the empire, through the Exarchate of Ravenna, the city of Rome, and the West, to the pope in the least. |
| 298 | Unde continue legitur imperatores usque ad tempora praefata, sicut prius, pleno iure Romam, Ravennam et Marchiam cum aliis locis possedisse. | Whence it is read that the emperors, up to the aforementioned times, possessed Rome, Ravenna, and the March, with other places, with full right, just as before. |
| 298 | Et probat textus 96 di. | And the text of 96 di proves this. |
| 298 | Bene quidem, ubi dicit de patricio praefecto nomine Odoacris regis etc. | Indeed, where it speaks of the patrician prefect named Odoacer, king, etc. |
| 298 | , et 63 di. | and 63 di. |
| 298 | Agatho, 96 di. | Agatho, 96 di. |
| 298 | Cum ad verum cum similibus. | With the truth, along with similar things. |
| 299 | Et Romanos pontifices legimus imperatores fateri dominos. | And we read that the Roman pontiffs call the emperors lords. |
| 299 | Scribit enim Agatho papa ad imperatorem Constantinum, qui sextam synodum congregavit et multis annis secutus est primum, quomodo urbs Roma sit ipsius imperatoris servilis urbs. | The text of Agatho, the pope, to Emperor Constantine, who convened the sixth synod and followed for many years, shows how the city of Rome is a servile city of the emperor himself. |
| 299 | Et Boni fatius papa ad Honorium, qui dicit quod ecclesiae Romanae ipse habet regere sacerdotium, sed imperator humanas res. | And Pope Boniface to Honorius, who says that he has to rule the priesthood of the Roman Church, but the emperor has human affairs. |
| 299 | Et in fine dicit Romam esse urbem suae mansuetudinis. | And at the end, it says that Rome is a city of his mildness. |
| 299 | Hic textus habetur 97 di. | This text is found in 97 di, Ecclesiae. |
| 299 | Ecclesiae. | And, to speak briefly, I have not read anything contrary, that up to the aforementioned times of Pippin, the emperor remained in possession of the aforementioned places. |
| 299 | Et, ut breviter dicam, nullibi contrarium legi, quin usque ad illa praefata Pippini tempora imperator remanserit in possessione locorum praetactorum. | Nor have I ever read that any of the Roman pontiffs, up to the time of Stephen II, presumed to have any right in those places for Saint Peter. |
| 300 | Nec umquam legi aliquem Romanorum pontificum usque ad tempora Stephani II. | These things, I believe, are true, notwithstanding the famous opinion to the contrary, which is found in Palea, Constantine, 96 di. |
| 300 | in illis locis sanctum Petrum aliquid iuris praesumpsisse habere. | For without a doubt, if that dictum were not apocryphal, Gratian would have found it in the old codices and collections of canons, and would have included it. |
| 300 | Haec credo vera esse non obstante famosa opinione de contrario, quae in Palea habetur Constantinus 96 di. | And since he did not find it, he did not include it. |
| 300 | Quoniam absque dubio, si non fuisset illud dictamen apocryphum, Gratianus in veteribus codicibus et canonum collectionibus invenisset. | Whence, whoever added it afterwards, placed it as a Palea, just as many other things are found inscribed in our apocryphal books. |
| 300 | Et quia non invenit, non posuit. | I also found this script in a certain book, which contains much more than what is found in the decree in the aforementioned place, and examining it diligently, I found manifest arguments of fiction and falsity, which would be long and useless to insert here. |
| 300 | Unde qui postea addidit, pro Palea ita illam confictam scripturam posuit, sicut multa alia inveniuntur ex apocryphis libris nostris inscripta. | It is also to be noted that the text of Constantine, 96 di, is extracted from the legend of Saint Silvester, and he who imposed authority on the decree, founded it in the approval of Gelasius in the synod. |
| 301 | Ego etiam ad longum hanc scripturam in quodam libro inveni, quae multo plus continet quam ea, quae in decreto ponuntur loco praeallegato, et diligenter eam examinans repperi ex ipsamet scriptura argumenta manifesta confictionis et falsitatis, quae pro nunc longum et inutile foret hic inserere. | I ask that it be seen in 15 di, the holy Roman approval, and it will be found to be of little strength, because it says that the author is unknown, and yet it is read by Catholics, and therefore can be read. |
| 302 | Etiam est advertendum, quod textus Constantinus 96 di. | What kind of approval anyone can consider. |
| 302 | est ex legenda sancti Silvestri extractus, et fundat ille, qui imposuit decreto auctoritatem ipsius textus, in approbatione Gelasii in synodo. | For there are many histories of Saint Silvester: one, in which this is not found, which Saint Damasus mentions, another, whose author is unknown, which the text does not say is true, but can be read, nor does it say that it contains this. |
| 302 | Rogo videatur 15 di. | Also, the ancient decrees do not have the text, except up to the § Item, and the decrees of the Roman pontiffs, inclusively, and thus this § on the history of Silvester is not found in those books. |
| 302 | Sancta Romana illa approbatio et invenietur pauci roboris, quia dicit auctorem ignorari et tamen per catholicos legi et eapropter legi posse. | The fifth universal synod, which makes mention of the approved books of all the doctors and approved scriptures, and also the synod of Pope Martin, which was against those who say there is one will in Christ, namely against Pyrrhus and Sergius, renewing the approved scriptures, as I myself have seen, makes no mention of those histories, nor is anyone approved or named among the truthful, whom I have ever seen. |
| 302 | Qualis sit approbatio quisque considerare potest. | I have read in Vincent, in the 24th book of histories, at the end, according to Saint Jerome, that Constantine cruelly killed his wife Fausta and son Crispus, and was baptized by Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, in the Arian heresy, towards the end of his life. |
| 303 | Multae enim sunt historiae sancti Silvestri: una, in qua hoc non invenitur, quam sanctus Damasus ponit, alia, cuius auctor ignoratur, quam textus non dicit veram, sed legi posse neque dicit in illa hoc contineri. | From which time, says Jerome, the plundering of the churches and the discord of the whole world followed, up to the present time. |
| 303 | Etiam antiqua decreta non habent textum nisi usque ad § Item decreta Romanorum pontificum inclusive, et sic non invenitur in illis libris iste § de historia Silvestri. | Those things in the book of the acts of Silvester, which Vincent says was translated from Greek by someone whose name is unknown, as is found in the same book, c. |
| 303 | Quinta etiam universalis synodus, quae de approbatis doctorum omnium et scripturarum approbatarum libris mentionem facit, ac etiam ipsa synodus Martini papae, quae fuit contra unam voluntatem in Christo dicentes, scilicet contra Pyrrhum et Sergium, renovans approbatas scripturas, ut egomet vidi, nullam de istis historiis faciunt mentionem, nec quisquam approbatus aut nominatus inter veridicos, quem umquam vidi. | 90, manifestly contradict. |
| 304 | Ego legi in Vincentio historiarum XXIV. | Who would not rather believe Jerome, an approved author, than the writings of an unknown author, which are called apocryphal, when the author is unknown? |
| 304 | libro in fine secundum sanctum Hieronymum Constantinum uxorem Faustam et filium Crispum crudeliter occidisse et in extremo vitae ab Eusebio Nicomediae episcopo baptizatum in Arrianam haeresim declinasse. | The text, which is ascribed to Pope Melchiades, which is found in 12 q, 1 Futuram, which seems to somewhat oppose this dictum, is not of Melchiades the pope, according to a certain gloss, and also the truth of the matter, because Melchiades preceded Silvester, as is clear in the catalog of the Roman pontiffs. |
| 304 | A quo tempore, inquit Hieronymus, ecclesiarum rapinae et totius orbis discordia secuta est usque in praesens tempus. | And if! Constantine was baptized by Silvester, according to common dictum, then it is clear that the title of that text is false, because it speaks of the baptism of Constantine. |
| 304 | Ista libro de actibus Silvestri, quem Vincentius dicit a quodam, cuius nomen ignorat, e Graeco translatum, ut eodem libro c. | And even if the text were of Melchiades, it would still not be an argument against the aforementioned, because it does not say anything other than that Constantine left the imperial see to Peter and his successors, that is, what was once the imperial see, is now the papal see, which is not denied. |
| 304 | 90 habetur, manifeste contradicunt. | And it is true that Constantine the emperor was in the time of Pope Melchiades and was then a Christian, as is found in many places by Augustine, and especially in the letter to Glorius and Elusius and Felicius the grammarian, and to those to whom this is pleasing, which begins: The apostle said indeed. |
| 304 | Quis non crederet potius Hieronymo approbato quam ignoti auctoris scripturis, quae apocryphae dicuntur, quando auctor ignoratur? | And this agrees with Jerome. |
| 305 | Textus etiam, qui ascribitur Melchiadi papae, qui habetur 12 q. | I have also seen the decree of Pope Leo in the Roman synod, with the subscription of bishops and clerics and Roman citizens, where Pope Leo restored to Otto I all the places given to Saint Peter by Pippin and Charles and Robert, kings. |
| 305 | 1 Futuram, qui videtur huic dicto aliquantulum obstare, non est Melchiadis papae secundum glossam quandam et etiam rei veritatem, quia Melchiades praecessit Silvestrum, ut patet in catalogo Romanorum pontificum. | And all the places are named in the same decree, and no mention is made of the donation of Constantine. |
| 305 | Et si Constantinus fuit baptizatus a Silvestro secundum commune dictum, tunc patet titulum illius textus falsum, quia loquitur de baptismo Constantini. | In my judgment, those things about Constantine are apocryphal, just as perhaps some other long and great writings attributed to Saints Clement and Anacletus, in which those who want to exalt the Roman see, worthy of all praise, more than the holy church requires and deserves, entirely or almost found. |
| 305 | Et etiam si Melchiadis foret ille textus, adhuc non haberetur argumentum ex eo contra praemissa, quia non dicit aliud quam Constantinum sedem Romanam imperialem reliquisse et Petro et successoribus concessisse, hoc est quod, ubi fuit sedes imperialis, quod ibi sit modo papalis, quod non negatur. | And thus they establish themselves. |
| 306 | Et verum est Constantinum imperatorem tempore Melchiadis papae fuisse et tunc Christianum, ut per Augustinum in multis locis habetur et maxime in epistula ad Glorium et Elusium et Felicium grammaticum et quibus hoc gratum est, quae incipit: Dixit quidem apostolus. | For it is not to be doubted that if that dictum were not apocryphal, Gratian would have found it in the old codices and collections of canons. |
| 306 | Et hoc concordat cum Hieronymo. | And since he did not find it, he did not include it. |
| 307 | Vidi etiam decretum Leonis papae in synodo Romana cum subscriptione episcoporum et clericorum et civium Romanorum, ubi Leo papa Ottoni I. | Whence, whoever added it afterwards, placed it as a Palea, just as many other things are found inscribed in our apocryphal books. |
| 307 | restituit omnia loca per Pippinum et Carolum et Robertum reges sancto Petro data. | I also found this script in a certain book, which contains much more than what is found in the decree in the aforementioned place. |
| 307 | Et nominantur in eodem decreto omnia loca, et nullam facit de donatione Constantini mentionem. | And examining it diligently, I found manifest arguments of fiction and falsity. |
| 307 | Sunt meo iudicio illa de Constantino apocrypha, sicut fortassis etiam quaedam alia longa et magna scripta sanctis Clementi et Anacleto papae attributa, in quibus volentes Romanam sedem omni laude dignam plus, quam ecclesiae sanctae expedit et decet, exaltare se penitus aut quasi fundant. | It is also to be noted that the text of Constantine, 96 di, is extracted from the legend of Saint Silvester. |
| 308 | Si quis illas omnes scripturas illis sanctis attributas diligenter perlegeret et eorum tempora ad illa scripta applicaret ac deinde in opusculis omnium sanctorum patrum, qui usque ad Augustinum, Hieronymum et Ambrosium fuere, ac etiam de gestis conciliorum, ubi authentica scripta allegantur, usum et memoriam haberet, hoc inveniret verum, quia nec in illis omnibus scripturis de illis praefatis epistulis mentio habetur et etiam ipsae epistulae applicatae ad tempus eorum sanctorum se ipsas produnt. | If anyone were to carefully read through all the scriptures attributed to those saints and apply their times to those writings, and then also consider the works of all the saintly fathers who lived up until the time of Augustine, Jerome, and Ambrose, as well as the deeds of the councils where authentic writings are cited, they would find this to be true: that neither in all those scriptures nor in the aforementioned letters is any mention made of those letters, and the letters themselves, when applied to the time of those saints, reveal their own falsity. |
| 309 | Scribitur in Clementis epistulis quomodo papa fuerit et Petri successor, et post Petri mortem ad sanctum Iacobum has fingit scriptor misisse epistulas, qui fuit frater domini et Hierosolymorum episcopus, et est manifestum Iacobum prius Petro octo annis finisse martyrio vitam. | It is written in the letters of Clement that he was a pope and the successor of Peter, and after Peter's death, the writer of the letters pretends to have sent them to Saint James, who was the brother of the Lord and the bishop of Jerusalem, and it is clear that James died a martyr's death eight years before Peter. |
| 309 | Et haec una de causis, cur inter canonicas epistulas ea, quae Iacobi sunt, praecedunt, ut scribit Beda super canonicis epistulis in principio. | And this is one of the reasons why, among the canonical letters, those of James precede the others, as Bede writes in his commentary on the canonical letters at the beginning. |
| 309 | Scribitur quoque ipsum Clementem successorem fuisse Petri. | It is also written that Clement himself was the successor of Peter. |
| 309 | Et hoc idem in aliis, quae sancto Anacleto ascribuntur, legitur. | And this same thing is read in the writings attributed to Saint Anacletus. |
| 309 | Quomodo sancti viri Hieronymus, Augustinus, Optatus Milevitanus et ceteri, qui omnium Romanorum pontificum catalogum posuerunt, hoc ignorassent, qui Clementem non interserunt, si ipsas epistulas aut tunc vidissent aut pro authenticis habuissent? | How could the holy men Jerome, Augustine, Optatus of Milevis, and the others, who compiled a catalog of all the Roman pontiffs, have been ignorant of this, since they do not include Clement, unless they had either seen those letters or considered them to be authentic? |
| 310 | Invenitur insuper in ipsis epistulis de episcoporum a sacerdotibus differentia, quae longo tempore post hoc, ut Hieronymo placet et Damaso, in ecclesia exorta est. | Furthermore, it is found in those letters themselves that there is a distinction between bishops and priests, which arose in the church a long time after, as Jerome and Damasus agree. |
| 310 | Ex allegatis etiam in ipsis epistulis ac aliis innumeris ista patere possent, quae hic supervacue ponerentur. | From the citations in those letters and many other things, it could be shown that these things, which would be unnecessarily presented here, are evident. |
| 311 | Non opus foret divinam ipsam omni laude superexcellentissimam Romanam primam sedem se hiis ambiguis iuvare argumentis, quae ex illis epistulis extracta Decreto Gratiani inserta inveniuntur – sufficienter quidem et multo elegantius veritas ipsa ex usitatis certis et approbatis sacris scripturis et doctorum scriptis absque haesitatione haberetur –, sicut nec de Constantini donatione se maiorem arguere deberet, quae, si etiam indubia foret, quid in spirituali cathedra potestatis ecclesiasticae augere posset, quisque intelligit. | There would be no need to use these ambiguous arguments, which are extracted from those letters and inserted into the Decretum of Gratian, to support the most excellent and praiseworthy Roman See, for the truth itself can be sufficiently and more elegantly understood from the usual, certain, and approved sacred scriptures and writings of the doctors without hesitation, just as it should not be argued that the donation of Constantine, even if it were undisputed, could increase the power of the spiritual throne of the ecclesiastical authority, which anyone can understand. |
| 311 | Nam adhuc dubitaretur de eius validitate, cum Accursius in Authentica Quomodo oportet episcopos post principium teneat, quod non, et Ioannes Teutonicus 63 di. | For there would still be doubt about its validity, since Accursius in the Authenticum Quomodo oportet episcopos holds the opposite view after the beginning, and Johannes Teutonicus in 63 di. |
| 311 | Ego Ludovicus teneat contrarium, de quo in Clementina Romani De iure iurando in glossa super verbo Constantinus. | I, Ludovicus, hold the contrary view, about which I wrote in the gloss on the word Constantinus in the Clementine De iure iurando. |
| 311 | Ego solum, quae diligenti inquisitione, quam pro veritate scienda reperire potui, scribo salvo in omnibus iudicio sacrae synodi. | I write only what I have been able to discover through diligent inquiry, seeking the truth, while deferring to the judgment of the sacred synod in all things. |
| 312 | Et si omnia illa, quae praenarrata sunt, ex acceptatione ecclesiae firma censeri debent, placet et mihi; quia etiam illis omnibus scripturis e medio sublatis sanctam Romanam ecclesiam primam summae potestatis et excellentiae inter cunctas sedes quisque catholicus fateretur. | And if all those things that have been previously narrated are to be considered firm based on the acceptance of the church, it also pleases me, because even if all those writings were to be removed, any Catholic would still acknowledge the holy Roman church as the first and supreme in power and excellence among all the sees. |
| 313 | Capitulum III. | Chapter III. |
| 313 | Verum adhuc volunt quidam, et est opinio vulgatissima, imperium translatum in Germanos per Hadrianum in personam Caroli Magni iuxta ea, quae Innocentius III. | Yet some still want to claim, and it is a very common opinion, that the empire was transferred to the Germans through Hadrian in the person of Charlemagne, according to what Innocent III says. |
| 313 | dicit in c. | in c. Venerabilem De electione. |
| 313 | Venerabilem De electione. | But I confess that I have never read this in the approved ancient books. |
| 313 | Sed fateor me numquam in antiquis approbatis libris hoc legisse. | Although Stephen II anointed Pippin and his two sons as kings, it is not said that there was a transfer of the empire. |
| 313 | Licet Stephanus II. | However, it is true that Charlemagne is called the Roman patrician in law and also in the deeds of Hadrian. |
| 313 | unxerit Pippinum et eius duos filios in reges, non tamen habetur de imperii translatione. | After the cities and places that were given to the right and property of Saint Peter by the gift of Pippin, Charlemagne's father, as mentioned in the deeds of Stephen II, and which were later increased because many cities gave themselves to the right of Saint Peter and their citizens were tonsured in the Roman manner, there was a need for a defender and patrician in all those places. |
| 313 | Verum quod Carolus in iure ac etiam gestis Hadriani patricius Romanus vocatur. | And Charlemagne was appointed as patrician, as is found in 63 di. c. Hadrianus. |
| 313 | Postquam enim dono Pippini patris Caroli ad ius et proprietatem sancti Petri devenerunt civitates et loca ibi in gestis Ste phani II. | In the synod where he himself is named the king of the Franks and the Lombards. |
| 313 | nominata, quae postea aucta sunt, quia plures civitates se ipsas dederunt iure sancti Petri et tonsi sunt cives illarum more Romanorum, tunc opus erat in illis omnibus locis defensore et patricio. | And the patrician had, since he was the father of the fatherland, the care of temporal judgment, and he presided over temporal matters, with the pope not intervening in them. |
| 313 | Et deputatus fuit Carolus Magnus pro patricio, ut habetur 63 di. | Indeed, the patrician, according to the ancient gloss in c. Hadrianus 63 di., was the father of the pope in temporal matters, just as the pope was his father in spiritual matters. |
| 313 | c. | The patricians were so called because they provided for the republic like fathers for their children, as Isidorus says in the IX book of Etymologies. |
| 313 | Hadrianus et c. | And crowned emperors were accustomed to be called patricians, as is read about Henry IV, who was in the year of Christ 1061. |
| 313 | In synodo, ubi ipse rex Franciae et Langobardorum nominatur. | Since, after the death of Nicholas II, the Romans sent him a crown and asked him to elect a pontiff, and after calling together many bishops of Italy and holding a general council in Basel, he was given the same crown and called the patrician of the Romans, where, with the common counsel of all and the Roman legates electing, Chadelo, the bishop of Parma, was declared pope on the seventh day before the Kalends of November, who was also named Honorius. |
| 313 | Et habebat patricius, quoniam pater patriae, curam iudicii temporalis, et praefuit in temporalibus papa se de ipsis minime intromittente. | But Anselm, a certain bishop of the city of Lucca in Tuscany, who was named Alexander, was pre-elected by certain Romans and Normans and occupied the throne for 27 days until his death. |
| 313 | Immo patricius secundum glossam antiquam in c. | He was succeeded by Hildebrand, who was also named Gregory VII, who excommunicated Emperor Henry. |
| 313 | Hadrianus 63 di. | From which the present council of Basel, 372 years after that of Basel in 1433, is celebrated, at which time the most serene Sigismund was crowned with the imperial diadem by Eugene in Rome and participated in the council like Henry and the other Catholic emperors. |
| 313 | pater papae in temporalibus fuit, sicut papa in spiritualibus eius pater. | It is now precisely 500 years since Henry I, the father of Otto I, the royal city of Basel, which is the same as the city of Augusta, was destroyed by the Hungarians and rebuilt and founded in the churches. |
| 313 | Patricii dicti, quia ipsi ut patres filiis rei publicae providebant, Isidorus IX. | I will not say more about this. |
| 313 | Etymologiarum. | Returning to the first point, admitting what has been said about the patriciate of Charlemagne, it does not follow that the empire was transferred to the Greeks on that account. |
| 314 | Et solebant coronati imperatores patricii vocari, ut legitur de Henrico IV. | Indeed, it is clearly evident in the deeds of the eighth council of Constantinople and also after that, up to the time of Otto I, that the popes Nicholas I and Hadrian II recognized Basil as the emperor, who convoked that synod, and his sons and Leo as emperors of the Romans. |
| 314 | , qui fuit anno Christi 1061. | And it is not found in the true histories that Charlemagne is named emperor, but rather king and patrician of the Romans, although some histories do have him receiving the name of Augustus from the Roman people towards the end of his life, and he is sometimes called emperor even after his death, as in 15 q. 6 Alius. |
| 314 | Quoniam mortuo Nicolao II. | For I have seen in the major church of Cologne a large volume of all the letters of Hadrian I to Charlemagne and Charlemagne's responses, and also copies of all the bulls, and I confess that I have never read about that transfer. |
| 314 | Romani coronam eidem miserunt et pro eligendo pontifice interpellaverunt, qui vocatis plerisque Italiae episcopis generalique conventu Basileae habito eadem imposita corona patricius Romanorum appellatus est, ubi communi omnium consilio Romanorumque legatis eligentibus Chadelo Parmensis praesul VII. | Nevertheless, I read that the name of emperor was commonly used in ancient times. |
| 314 | Kalendis Novembris papa declaratur, qui et Honorius nominabatur. | For the emperor was called the elect of the army, as Saint Jerome says in 93 di. |
| 314 | Sed Anselmus, quidam episcopus Lucae civitatis Tusciae, qui Alexander nominabatur, a certis Romanis et Normannis praeelectus 27 diebus cathedram occupavit usque ad mortem. | We read, and especially in the histories, that the kings of Italy were called emperors, just as I have also read that Berengar was named emperor, and many others as well. |
| 314 | Cui successit Hildebrandus, qui et Gregorius VII. | Even Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, is read to have been called emperor, 63 di. Ego Ludovicus, and 4 di. c. De capitulis, it is proven that Lothair is named emperor and pontiff, and similarly it is clear about Louis. |
| 314 | , qui Henricum imperatorem excommunicavit. | Therefore, if all things are well resolved, those who had the power to rule, especially in Italy, were accustomed to be called emperors or kings. |
| 315 | Unde hodiernum concilium Basiliense distans 372 annis ab illo Basileae 1433 celebratur, cuius tempore serenissimus Sigismundus Romae ab Eugenio imperiali diademate insignitus et concilio ut ipse Henricus et ceteri catholici imperatores interest. | Hence the present council of Basel, 372 years distant from that of Basel in 1433, is celebrated, at which time the most serene Sigismund was crowned with the imperial diadem in Rome by Eugenius and attended the council, as did Henry and other Catholic emperors. |
| 315 | Sunt vere nunc anni praecise 500, quibus per Henricum I. | Now precisely 500 years have passed since Henry I. |
| 315 | patrem Ottonis I. | the father of Otto I. |
| 315 | ipsa Basilea civitas, id est regalis civitas, destructa magna Augusta, quae non multum distanter situata erat, per Hungaros funditus, aedificata et in ecclesiis fundata fuit. | the city of Basel itself, that is, the royal city, destroyed by the Hungarians, which was not far distant, was rebuilt and founded in churches. |
| 315 | De hoc non plura. | No more on this. |
| 316 | Redeundo ad primum admittendo ea, quae de patriciatu Caroli dicta sunt, non sequitur, quod eapropter fuit de Graecis imperium translatum. | Returning to the first point, admitting what has been said about the patriciate of Charles, it does not follow that the empire was therefore transferred from the Greeks. |
| 316 | Immo in gestis octavi Constantinopolitani concilii manifeste apparet ac etiam post hoc usque ad Ottonem I. | Rather, in the acts of the eighth council of Constantinople, it is clearly shown, and also after this up to Otto I. |
| 316 | , quod Roma nipontifices Nicolaus I. | that the popes Nicholas I. |
| 316 | , Hadrianus II. | and Adrian II. |
| 316 | recognoscunt Basilium imperatorem, qui illam synodum convocavit, et filios suos ac Leonem post hoc imperatores Romanorum. | recognized Basil as emperor, who convened that synod, and his sons and Leo as emperors of the Romans. |
| 316 | Et non invenitur in ipsis historiis veris Carolum nominatum imperatorem sed regem et patricium Romanorum, licet quaedam historiae habeant ipsum in fine vitae quasi Augusti nomen a Romano populo recepisse et etiam post eius mortem imperator nominetur aliquando, ut 15 q. | And in those true histories, Charles is not found named as emperor but as king and patrician of the Romans, although some histories have it that he received the name Augustus from the Roman people at the end of his life and was sometimes called emperor after his death, as in 15 q. |
| 316 | 6 Alius. | 6 Another. |
| 316 | Ego enim Coloniae in maiori ecclesia volumen ingens omnium missivarum Hadriani I. | For I in Cologne, in the greater church, saw a huge volume of all the letters of Adrian I. |
| 316 | ad Carolum et ipsius Caroli responsiones et insuper copias omnium bullarum vidi et fateor me numquam translationem illam legisse. | to Charles and Charles's responses and also copies of all the bulls, and I confess that I never read of that transfer. |
| 317 | Tamen imperii nomen multum lego commune antiquitus fuisse. | Yet I read much that the name of the empire was common in antiquity. |
| 317 | Vocabatur enim imperator electus per exercitum, ut dicit sanctus Hieronymus 93 di. | For he was called emperor elected by the army, as Saint Jerome says, 93 di. |
| 317 | Legimus, et maxime in historiis reges Italiae imperatores fuisse leguntur, sicut etiam legi Berengarium imperatorem nominatum et etiam multi alii. | We read, and especially in histories, that the kings of Italy were called emperors, as I also read that Berengar was called emperor and many others. |
| 317 | Etiam Ludovicus Pius rex Franciae legitur imperator, 63 di. | Also Louis the Pious, king of France, is read as emperor, 63 di. |
| 317 | Ego Ludovicus, et 4 di. | I Louis, and 4 di. |
| 317 | c. | c. |
| 317 | De capitulis probatur Lotharium imperatorem et pontificem nominari, et similiter de Ludovico patet ibidem. | From the chapters, it is proven that Lothar is called emperor and pontiff, and similarly of Louis, it is clear there. |
| 317 | Unde si omnia bene resolvuntur, qui imperare habebant, maxime in Italia, imperatores vocari aut reges solebant. | Hence if all things are well resolved, those who were to rule, especially in Italy, were usually called emperors or kings. |
| 318 | Scimus deinde quomodo post mortem Conradi regis defecit illa successio regum a Pippino et Carolo, et quomodo ordinatione et suasu ipsius Conradi iam in ultimis agentis Henricus dux Saxoniae in regem electus est et ad eum insignia regia Conradi delata sunt. | We know then how, after the death of King Conrad, that succession of kings from Pippin and Charles failed, and how, by the appointment and persuasion of Conrad himself, acting in his final days, Henry, Duke of Saxony, was elected king and the royal insignia of Conrad were bestowed upon him. |
| 318 | Ac insuper scimus, quomodo regnum per successionem in Ottonem I. | And furthermore we know how the kingdom came to Otto I |
| 318 | , II. | , II. |
| 318 | et III. | and III. |
| 318 | devenit et tunc tempore Henrici et Ottonis I. | by succession, and then during the time of Henry and Otto I. |
| 318 | maximae divisiones et guerrae in Italia et hincinde per mundum fuerunt, et quomodo iam ille, iam iste, iam Arnulfus, post Be rengarius, et tunc Hugo, tunc Albericus inter se guerras habuere. | there were greatest divisions and wars in Italy and thence throughout the world, and how now one, now another, now Arnulf, after Berengar, and then Hugh, then Alberic, waged war among themselves. |
| 318 | Hugo enim rex Romam et ceteras vicinas regiones diu sub se habuit, deinde expulsus Albericus eandem Romanam civitatem occupavit. | For Hugh, king, held Rome and the other neighboring regions for a long time under his sway, then expelled, Alberic seized the same Roman city. |
| 319 | Et de similibus multa et varia videre posset, qui legeret historiam Liutprandi diaconi Ticinensis ecclesiae ad Raimundum Hispaniae provinciae Liberitanum episcopum, qui fuit in cancellaria Berengarii, quoniam, quod a tempore Basilii imperatoris Constantini eius filii et huius filii Leonis et a Carolo Calvo usque ad Ottonem I. | And many and varied similar things could be seen by one who read the history of Liutprand, deacon of the Church of Ticinum, to Raymond, bishop of the province of Spain Liberitana, who was in the chancery of Berengar, because he wrote explicitly and truly, from the time of Emperor Basil, of his son Constantine, and of this son Leo, and from Charles the Bald up to Otto I. |
| 319 | hincinde in Europa actum est, diserte scripsit et vere, cum tunc multis arduis idem ipse interfuit. | what happened in Europe, since he himself was present at many difficult matters at that time. |
| 320 | Unde si cuncta resolvis, tunc ab Henrico I. | Therefore, if one resolves all things, then from Henry I. |
| 320 | Alemanni per virtutes armorum et maxime per primum Ottonem regni Italiae et urbis Romanae, regni Arelatensis ac ipsius Germaniae dominia acquisiverunt, et ex tunc nominati sunt imperatores, postquam Berengarius, Hugo, Arnulfus et Albericus et ceteri tempore primi Ottonis defecere. | the Alemanni through the strength of arms, and especially through the first Otto, acquired the kingdoms of Italy and the Roman city, the kingdom of Arles, and Germany itself, and from then on were called emperors, after Berengar, Hugh, Arnulf, and Alberic, and others, had failed during the time of the first Otto. |
| 320 | Nec repperi tempore Stephani II. | Nor did I find that in the time of Stephen II. |
| 320 | vel Hadriani Urbem ab imperio umquam recessisse aut a Pippino vel Carolo subactam, licet bene post hoc usque ad Ottonem multi tyrannice eandem occupassent, a quorum manibus per Ottonem victorem liberata est. | or Hadrian the city ever withdrew from the empire or was subdued by Pippin or Charles, although many tyrannically seized it after this, up to Otto, from whose hands it was liberated by the victorious Otto. |
| 320 | Et propter hoc ipse in eodem textu 63 di. | And for this reason he in the same text 63 di. |
| 320 | In synodo nominatur imperator et rex, et declarat synodus pro bono statu regis, quod nemo patricium ponere possit nisi ipse, quia rex, sicut Odoacrum patricium posuit, quia rex, 96 di. | is named emperor and king in the synod, and the synod declares for the good state of the king that no one can appoint a patrician except himself, because the king, just as Odoacer appointed a patrician, because the king, 96 di. |
| 320 | Bene quidem. | Well indeed. |
| 320 | Patricius enim est pater papae in temporalibus iuxta praehabita. | For the patrician is the father of the pope in temporal matters according to the foregoing. |
| 321 | Et nota, quod illa constitutio synodica 63 di. | And note that that synodical constitution 63 di. |
| 321 | In synodo fuit cleri et populi Romani, et populus Romanus numquam in imperatorem transtulit talem potestatem, quin sibi adhuc maioritatem reservaret, ut notat Cardinalis in c. | was in the synod of the clergy and people of Rome, and the Roman people never transferred such power to the emperor without reserving for themselves a greater authority, as the Cardinal notes in c. |
| 321 | Venerabilem ex capitulo De aere. | Venerable from the chapter De aere. |
| 321 | Habetur enim in ecclesia Lateranensi Romae adhuc hodie illa aerea tabula, in qua senatus populusque Romanus potestatem, quam dedit Vespasiano, litteris exaravit, quae in Lateranensi ecclesia de Vespasiano et sibi indultis habetur. | For in the Lateran Church in Rome there is still today that bronze tablet, on which the senate and people of Rome recorded the power they gave to Vespasian, which is found in the Lateran Church concerning Vespasian and the grants made to them. |
| 321 | Et hoc etiam probatur per dictum Hostiensis in Summa De constitutionibus § Quis possit verbo Item populus, qui dicit quod illud, quod dicitur C. | And this is also proven by the statement of Hostiensis in the Summa De constitutionibus § Quis possit verbo Item populus, who says that that which is called C. |

| 322 | Ideo cum iste rex et victor factus esset Romanorum et liberator et ab imperatore Graecorum, qui tunc Constantinopoli habitabat, non tuerentur Romani, consensum dederunt, ut imperator esset Otto. | Therefore, since this king and victor had become the Romans' liberator and from the Greek emperor, who then resided in Constantinople, the Romans would not be protected, they agreed that Otto should be emperor. |
| 322 | Vigor ordinati imperii a Romanis et eorum consensu ortum habet, ut dicetur infra. | The vigor of the ordained empire has its origin from the Romans and their consent, as will be said below. |
| 322 | Et ideo, postquam Otto fuit vocatus, ut ipse tyranno expulso regnum Romanorum caperet, et hoc fuit roboratum per consensum synodi, cleri et populi, tunc ordinatum et iustum imperium ipse cum successoribus sunt consecuti. | And therefore, after Otto was called to take the Roman kingdom, expelling the tyrant, and this was confirmed by the consent of the synod, clergy, and people, he and his successors obtained an ordained and just empire. |
| 323 | Quomodo autem urbis Romanae ac Italiae dominium per Ottonem Romanis desiderantibus armis acquisitum fuerit, longum nimis foret enarrare. | How, however, the dominion of the Roman city and Italy was acquired by Otto, with the Romans desiring it by arms, would be too long to relate. |
| 323 | Et miror multum, quod Gratianus 63 di. | And I marvel greatly that Gratian 63 di. |
| 323 | In synodo loquens de investituris episcoporum, qui textus Ottonem probat imperatorem regem Italiae et Teutonicorum, non posuit illam restitutionem civitatum quondam donatarum Romanae ecclesiae papae per reges Franciae. | speaking in the synod about the investiture of bishops, who proves Otto as emperor, king of Italy and the Germans, did not place that restitution of the cities formerly granted to the Roman Church to the pope by the kings of France. |
| 323 | Et quia tenuit tale dominium urbis Romae et Italiae, Otto imperator nominatus est ipse et omnes sui successores, licet dominium urbis et civitatum donatarum quondam per Pippinum et Carolum et post hoc per alios reges, 63 di. | And because he held such dominion over the city of Rome and Italy, Otto himself was named emperor, and all his successors, although the dominion of the city and the formerly granted cities by Pippin and Charles, and after this by other kings, 63 di. |
| 323 | Ego Ludovicus, restitutum sit Romano pontifici. | I, Louis, let the Roman pontiff be restored. |
| 323 | Et sine dubio aliquid sibi restituentes ecclesiae reservarunt, ratione cuius ultra regium nomen imperii nomine ad instar priscorum decorantur, sicut quondam Carolus Magnus patriciatum, et vocatur advocatia in c. | And undoubtedly, in restoring something to themselves, they reserved something to the Church, by reason of which, beyond the royal name, they are adorned with the name of empire, in the manner of the ancients, just as Charles the Great held the patriciate, and is called advocate in c. |
| 323 | Venerabilem De electione. | Venerable De electione. |
| 323 | Si enim in homines subiectos ecclesiae imperator nihil imperii haberet, quomodo posset ipse per coerctionem ipsos ad oboedientiam iuris sancti Petri arctare? | For if the emperor had no imperial power over the subjects of the Church, how could he constrain them to obedience to the law of Saint Peter by coercion? |
| 323 | Et quomodo iura sancti Petri posset, sicut iurat, apostolico conservare, 63 di. | And how could he, as he swears, preserve the rights of Saint Peter, 63 di. |
| 323 | Tibi domino? | To you, Lord? |
| 324 | Sed extendere me pro nunc nolo in istis, quia praesentis speculationis non sunt. | But I do not wish to extend myself for now on these matters, because they are not of the present speculation. |

| 325 | Omne enim ordinatum imperium vel regnum, ut superius quodam loco dictum est, ex electione ortum capit, et tunc vera dei providentia censetur praelatus. | For every ordained empire or kingdom, as stated above in a certain place, arises from election, and then true divine providence is considered to be the prelate. |
| 325 | Unde Valentinianus et Martianus imperatores ad Leonem papam de congreganda synodo scribunt sic: «Victores Valentinianus et Martianus, gloriosi triumphatores semper augusti, Leoni, reverendo archiepiscopo gloriosae civitatis Romae. | Therefore, the emperors Valentinian and Martian write to Pope Leo about convening a synod thus: "Victorious Valentinian and Martian, glorious triumphators, ever august, to Leo, reverend archbishop of the glorious city of Rome. |
| 325 | Ad hoc maximum imperium veri dei providentia et electione senatus excellentissimi cunctaeque militiae profecti sumus. | To this greatest empire, by the providence and election of the most excellent senate and all the soldiery, we have come. |

| 326 | , pater Ottonis, ordinatione Conradi regis legitur per electionem constitutus rex, cum prius esset dux Saxoniae, et primo factus est rex Teutonicorum. | , father of Otto, is read to have been appointed king by the appointment of King Conrad, by election, when he was previously Duke of Saxony, and was first made king of the Germans. |
| 326 | Otto vero eius filius a synodo et Romano populo accepit potestatem successorem sibi eligendi, ut dicit textus In synodo 63 di. | Otto, however, his son, received from the synod and the Roman people the power to elect his successor, as the text In synodo 63 di. |
| 326 | allegatus, et hoc quoad regnum Italiae. | alleges, and this as regards the kingdom of Italy. |
| 326 | Secundum glossam et secundum illam ordinationem usque ad tertium Ottonem successio servata est. | According to the gloss and according to that appointment, the succession was maintained until the third Otto. |
| 327 | Post cuius mortem Henricus II. | After whose death Henry II. |
| 327 | filius fratris tertii Ottonis electus est, et hic imperator consensu procerum, primatum et utriusque status, cleri et populi, perpetuos electores, qui vice omnium eligerent, ordinavit tempore Gregorii V. | son of the brother of the third Otto, was elected, and this emperor, with the consent of the nobles, the prelates, and both estates, clergy and people, ordained perpetual electors, who would elect in the place of all, during the time of Gregory V. |
| 327 | Alemanni, consanguinei quondam Ottonis. | The Alemanni, formerly kinsmen of Otto. |
| 327 | Non est igitur eo modo concedendum electores a Romano pontifice potestatem eligendi habere, sic quod, nisi ipse consentiret, non haberent, aut si vellet, ab ipsis tollere posset. | Therefore, it is not to be conceded in that way that the electors have the power to elect from the Roman pontiff, so that unless he consents, they would not have it, or if he wished, he could take it from them. |
| 328 | Quis dedit, rogo, populo Romano potestatem eligendi imperatorem nisi ipsum ius vivinum et naturale? | Who, I ask, gave the Roman people the power to elect the emperor, except the law of nature itself? |
| 328 | Per viam enim voluntariae subiectionis et consensus in praesidentiam praelationes concordantiales rectae et sanc tae constitutae sunt in omni dominandi specie. | For by the way of voluntary submission and consent, concordant and righteous and holy prelatures have been established in every kind of dominion. |
| 328 | Omnis enim violentia iuri obviat. | For every violence is contrary to law. |

| 329 | Sicut enim in Toletano concilio anno Christi 581 tempore Sisenandi regis in c. | Just as in the Council of Toledo in the year of Christ 581, during the time of King Sisenand, in c. |
| 329 | 75 statutum fuit, tunc defuncto rege primates gentis cum sacerdotibus successorem regni consilio communi constituere habent, ut dum unitatis concordia retinetur, nullum patriae gentisque dissidium per vim ambitionis oriatur. | 75 it was decreed, then, upon the death of the king, the primates of the nation with the priests have the duty to appoint the successor of the kingdom by common counsel, so that while the concord of unity is maintained, no dissension of the country or nation arises through the violence of ambition. |
| 329 | Et subiungit constitutio quod, qui aliter tyrannice regnum usurpaverit, ille excommunicatus sit et ponit horrendam anathematizationem et maledictionem. | And the constitution adds that whoever tyrannically usurps the kingdom in another way shall be excommunicated, and it sets forth a terrible anathema and curse. |
| 330 | Dicuntur enim reges Graece basilici eo, quod tamquam bases in colligantia concordantiali populum sustineant, quare bases coronas habent. | Kings are called "basileus" in Greek because, like bases in a concordant assembly, they sustain the people, hence they bear crowns. |
| 330 | Tyranni Graece idem quod reges Latine. | Tyrants are the same as kings in Greek and kings in Latin. |
| 330 | Nam tyro fortis dicitur et tyrannus fortis rex. | For a tyro (a newcomer) is called strong and a tyrant is called a strong king. |
| 330 | Et postea in usum venit, ut tyranni dicantur pessimi et improbi reges luxuriosae dominationis cupiditatem et crudelissimam dominationem in populo exercentes, ut dicit Isidorus IX. | Later, it came into use to call tyrants the worst and most wicked kings, exercising a lust for cruel domination over the people, as Isidore says in Book IX. |
| 330 | Etymologiarum. | Etymologies. |
| 330 | Invasores itaque dominii non vocati nec electi tyranni dicuntur. | Therefore, those called tyrants are neither named nor chosen; they are called tyrants. |
| 331 | Ecce si ea, quae superius habentur, ad mentem revoces, quomodo omnis superioritas ordinata ex electiva concordantia spontaneae subiectionis exoritur, et quod populo illud divinum seminarium per communem omnium hominum aequalem nativitatem et aequalia naturalia iura inest, ut omnis potestas, quae principaliter a deo est sicut et ipse homo, tunc divina censeatur, quando per concordantiam communem a subiectis exoritur, ut sic constitutus, quasi in se omnium voluntatem gestans in principando, publica et communis persona ac pater singulorum vocetur in recta regulari ordinata potentia cuncta gubernans absque fastu superbiae, dum se quasi omnium collective subiectorum sibi creaturam cognoscit, singulorum pater exsistat. | Behold, if you recall what was said earlier, every superiority arises from an elective concord, spontaneous subjection, and a divine and natural law that is in the people, for all power that is from God, like man himself, is considered divine when it arises from a common agreement among the subjects, acting as if it were the will of all in governing, being called a public and common persona and father of all, governing all things with right, regular, and ordered power without pride or arrogance, recognizing itself as the creation of all subjects collectively, being the father of each individual. |
| 331 | Hoc est illud ordinatum spiritualis colligantiae divinum matrimonium in radice durativae concordantiae assituatum, per quod ista res publica optime ad finem aeternae felicitatis summa pace dirigitur. | This is the ordered spiritual union of divine marriage established in the root of durable concord, through which this commonwealth is best directed to the end of eternal happiness with the utmost peace. |
| 331 | Et quia huius radices divini et humani iuris superius habentur, non replico idem. | Because the roots of divine and human law are above, I will not say the same thing again. |
| 332 | Sufficit scire quod electio libera a naturali et divino iure dependens non habet ortum a positivo iure aut homine quocumque, ut in eius arbitrio exsistat quoad hoc validitas electionis maxime in eligendo regem et imperatorem, cuius esse et posse ab homine uno non dependet. | It is enough to know that free election, depending on natural and divine law, does not have its origin in positive law or any man, so that its validity exists in his arbitration to a certain extent, especially in electing a king or emperor, whose being and ability do not depend on one man. |
| 332 | Unde electores, qui communi consensu omnium Alemannorum et aliorum, qui imperio subiecti erant, tempore secundi Henrici constituti sunt, radicalem vim habent ab ipso communi omnium consensu, qui sibi naturali iure imperatorem constituere poterant, non ab ipso Romano pontifice, in cuius potestate non est dare cuicumque provinciae per mundum regem vel imperatorem ipsa non consentiente. | Therefore, the electors, who were established by the common consent of all Germans and others subject to their empire in the time of the second Henry, have a fundamental power from the common consent of all, who could naturally constitute an emperor, not from the Roman pontiff, in whose power it is not to give a king or emperor to any province in the world without the consent of that province. |
| 333 | Sed concurrebat ad hoc consensus ipsius Gregorii V. | However, the consensus of Gregory V, as one of the Roman pontiffs, also contributed to this, in accordance with his rank, as he should participate in the common election of an emperor, just as his authority participates in the first degree in the universal councils, through the consent of all who celebrate the council with him. |
| 333 | tamquam unius pontificis Romani, qui iuxta gradum suum in consentiendo in communem imperatorem interesse habet, recte sicut in conciliis universalibus concurrit in primo gradu auctoritas ipsius per consensum cum aliis omnibus ipsum concilium celebrantibus. | Nevertheless, the vigor of the definition depends not on the first pope of all, but on the common consent of all, including him and others. |
| 333 | Vigor nihilominus diffinitionis non ab ipso primo omnium pontifice, sed ex communi omnium et ipsius et aliorum consensu dependet. | However, because the consensus of the bishop (pope) should also intervene in the election of a king or emperor, this is not because the royal power is superior to the priesthood, because we know that the priesthood and the moon's power are equal, as in c. |
| 333 | Sed quod in constituendo rege aut imperatore ipsius sacerdotii sicut et laicorum consensus intervenire debet, hoc non est ex eo, quia imperium regium supereminet imperative sacerdotio, quia scimus sacerdotium soli et imperium lunae aequari, ut in c. | However, this is not because the royal power is superior to the priesthood, but because the temporal powers are accidental, without which the priesthood cannot subsist for a while in this transient life, and it is subject to the empire, as Augustine says in Book 8. |
| 333 | Solitae De maioritate et oboedientia, sed quia ipsa accidentalia rerum temporalium, sine quibus sacerdotium in hac caduca vita aliquamdiu subsistere nequit, ipsi imperio, ut vult Augustinus 8 di. | By what right, 23 q. |
| 333 | Quo iure, 23 q. | 7 Whoever, and their laws, are subject to them. |
| 333 | 7 Quicumque, et suis legibus subsunt. | Therefore, it is the concern of the one who preserves the priesthood to also consent to the king. |
| 334 | Cui igitur cura esse debet de conservando sacerdotio in esse, illius interest etiam in regem consentire. | Therefore, it concerns the Roman pontiff, who takes the greatest care of the priesthood, very much, so that I believe the consensus of the Roman pontiff began from the beginning when these electors were established. |
| 334 | Quare ad Romanum pontificem, qui de sacerdotio maximam curam gerit, valde spectat, ita quod puto in veritate consensum Romani pontificis a principio intervenisse, dum isti electores constituerentur. | Therefore, these electing in a common legation of all who are subject to the empire, and also of the entire priesthood and the Roman pontiff, elect. |
| 334 | Unde ipsi communi fungentes legatione omnium, qui imperio subsunt, etiam totius sacerdotii et Romani pontificis, eligunt. | Whoever is elected without a doubt obtains all of this, as John notes in the gloss 93 q. |
| 334 | Qui electus sine dubio ex ipsa electione cuncta consequitur, ut notat Ioannes in glossa 93 di. | We read about Innocent in c. |
| 334 | Legimus et Innocentius in c. | Venerable on the election, and it is held that it is noted by Hostiensis on the signification of words in Super quibusdam, and in the gloss on the Clementina of the Roman pontiff on the word "kings." |
| 334 | Venerabilem De electione, et ita tenetur, ut notat Hostiensis De verborum significatione Super quibusdam, et glossa in Clementinam Romani super verbo reges. | Because he has the subjection of all and, consequently, the power of command, in which the essence of the empire consists. |
| 334 | Quoniam subiectionem omnium habet et per consequens imperandi potestatem, in qua consistit imperii essentia. | They were previously called those who exercised command over the army. |
| 335 | Dicti enim prius fuere ab imperando exercitui. | Unction or coronation, which is also read to be given to other kings, does not argue for the superiority of the pope over the election or the power of the empire in temporal matters, just as the unction that is given to the king of France by Remigius, or the coronation of the emperor himself by the archbishop of Cologne in Aachen, does not argue for the superiority of the pope over the election or the power of the empire in temporal matters. |
| 335 | Unctio aut coronatio, quae etiam legimus aliis regibus tribui, nec arguunt in papa maioritatem supra ipsam electionem confirmandam vel infirmandam vel super ipsum etiam imperium quoad temporalia, sicut nec unctio, quae fit regi Franciae Remis, aut coronatio ipsiusmet imperatoris per archiepiscopum Coloniensem in Aquis. | And this is evident from the fact that it is read that Otto I was anointed by Archbishop Hildebert of Mainz in Aachen as king of Germany and France with the consent and will of the princes and the entire people of Germany, Saxony, and France. |
| 335 | Et hoc patet ex eo, quia legitur Ottonem I. | Similarly, it is read that Henry I was anointed by Archbishop Heriger of Mainz with the diadem offered by the common consent of all, who, receiving the diadem, did not want to be anointed, because he said he was unworthy. |
| 335 | ab archiepiscopo Moguntinensi Hildeberto Aquisgrani inunctum in regem Alemanniae et Francorum de consensu et voluntate principum et totius populi Alemanniae, Saxoniae et Franciae. | From which it is evident that the anointing and diadem confer no imperial power. |
| 335 | Sic etiam legitur ab Hergero archiepiscopo Moguntinensi unctionem et diadema mortuo Conrado rege Henrico I. | These insignia are imposed as symbols of sacred majesty, which is in the empire, with material visible ceremonies, to be signs proclaiming admirable power, just as similar things are seen to be done in the Roman pontiff, who, however, is the pope after the election. |
| 335 | de communi omnium consensu oblatam, qui recepto diademate noluit inungi, quia dixit se indignum. | The name is also changed in the coronation that is conferred by the pope on the emperor, from king to emperor, which does not argue that there was less power of commanding in him before, as is well known. |
| 336 | Ex quibus patet unctionem et diadema nihil praestare imperialis potestatis. | Therefore, he was indeed an emperor when he had free power to command, even if he was not called by that name, but because he anguished for the coronation as a king, this name is preserved for the sake of this solemnity. |
| 336 | Insignia enim illa quasi ad maiestatem sacram, quae imperio inest, ostendendam materiali visibili subiecto imperii cum cerimoniis impenduntur, ut sint signa praedicantia admirandam illam potentiam, sicut similia in Romano pontifice videmus fieri, qui tamen ante omnia talia papa est post electionem. | About this coronation, the diadems and others are noted in the gloss on the Clementina of the Roman pontiff attached to the word vestiges. |
| 336 | Nomen etiam, quod in coronatione, quae per papam imperatori impenditur, mutatur, ut prius rex et postea imperator vocetur, nihil prius minus potentiae imperandi in eo fuisse arguit, ut notissimum est. | For as Isidore says in Etymologies, dukes were called with imperial titles, and the senate decided that this name should be the only one and that it should be distinguished from the kings of other nations. |
| 336 | Fuit itaque in veritate imperator, dum in libera potestate habuit imperare, etiam si vulgo non ita nominaretur, sed ut ad ipsam coronationem anhelet rex, servatur huic solempnitati hoc nomen. | From this, the Caesars have taken this name to this day, especially when they are anointed by the Roman pontiff, from whom the Roman empire depends. |
| 337 | De qua quidem coronatione diadematis et aliis notat glossa in Clementina Romani allegata super verbo vestigiis. | And because this matter has been treated by many in a very learned manner, it is enough for us to know that our electors of the empire, when they elect one with the common consent of all who are subject to the empire, through a concordant transfusion in them, in which this concord is included the consensus of the Roman pontiff Gregory V. |
| 337 | Dum enim, ut dicit Isidorus IX. | And from this election, the emperor is made without any confirmation, just as the power is transferred to certain princes of both statuses by this concord, and, when it is equal to be able to take away this power from them, I do not think that the Roman pontiff can abdicate this power only from them, but with the concurrence of the consensus of the Roman pontiff and all others, this power can be taken away. |
| 337 | Etymologiarum, duces titulis imperatoriis fungerentur, senatus censuit, ut Augusti Caesaris hoc tantum nomen esset et eo nomine a ceteris gentium regibus distingueretur. | And this is the common opinion of all experts that the Roman people can take away the power to make laws from the emperor, because they have this power. |
| 337 | Ex hoc Caesares sibi hactenus hoc nomen ceperunt, maxime dum a Romanorum pontifice, a quibus Romanum imperium dependet, diademate insignitur. | Thus, we read that the Roman people, for a long time, did not bear the arrogance of the kings, making annual emperors and two consuls, just as we read about dictators and others who seemed to fit their rule according to the times. |
| 338 | Et quia haec materia a multis disertissime est tractata, sufficiat nobis scire, quod nostri electores imperii, dum eligunt uno communi omnium, qui subsunt imperio, &laddconsensu&radd, per concordem omnium transfusionem in eos, in qua quidem concordia Romanus pontifex Gregorius V. | And because this matter has been treated most eloquently by many, it suffices for us to know that our electors of the empire, when they elect with the common consent of all who are under the empire, by the harmonious transfusion into them, in which harmony the Roman pontiff Gregory V. |
| 338 | includebatur, hoc agunt. | was included, do this. |
| 338 | Et ex hoc ex electione imperator efficitur absque quacumque confirmatione, recte sicut in cardinales universalis ecclesiae potestas per communem omnium tacitum vel quondam expressum consensum in eligendo papam transfusa est, et ideo absque omni confirmatione electus papa est. | And from this, by the election, the emperor is made without any confirmation, just as in the cardinals of the universal church, the power is transfused by the common tacit or sometimes express consent in electing the pope, and therefore the elected pope is without any confirmation. |
| 339 | Et sicut potestas electiva hac concordantia venit in certos utriusque status principes, ita, cum par esse debeat potestas tollendi ab ipsis hanc potestatem, non puto Romanum pontificem solum ab ipsis principibus abdicare posse, sed concurrente tam ipsius Romani pontificis quam aliorum omnium consensu non dubitatur ab ipsis tolli posse hanc potestatem. | And as the elective power comes by this harmony into certain princes of both states, so, since the power to remove this power from them should be equal, I do not think the Roman pontiff alone can abdicate them, but with the concurrent consent of the Roman pontiff and all others, it is not doubted that this power can be removed from them. |
| 339 | Et hoc est commune omnium peritorum dictum potestatem condendi leges populum Romanum ab imperatore tollere posse, quoniam ab ipsis potestatem habet. | And this is the common saying of all experts, that the power of making laws can be taken from the Roman people by the emperor, since he has the power from them. |
| 339 | Sic legimus populum Romanum longo tempore a regibus rectum superbiam regum non ferentem annua imperia binosque consules fecisse, sic et dictatores et cetera, quae suo regimini secundum tempora videbantur convenire. | So we read that the Roman people, for a long time, not bearing the pride of kings, made annual magistracies and two consuls, so also dictators and other things that seemed suitable to their rule according to the times. |

| 343 | Et secundum hoc oportet dicere, quod imperator Romanorum secundum imperium, quod quondam Romani virtutibus acquisiverunt, ut dicit textus 28 q. | And according to this, it must be said that the emperor of the Romans, according to the empire acquired through former Roman virtues, as the text states 28 q. |
| 343 | 1 § Ex hiis, dicitur imperator mundi dominus, a maiori parte ipsius mundi nomen capiens, quoniam Romani maiorem mundi partem subiectam habuerunt, non totam, quia Ca<sp>ios montes et portas Alexandri versus Scythiam septentrionalem et Norwegiam et partes ultra Caspium mare, ultra Imaum montem et regnum Senae ac etiam ultra Carmaniam desertam versus Indiam et <orientem,> Aracosiam et illas Indicas regiones, quae ultra Indum fluvium et Gangem exsistunt, et maximam omnium Taprobanam insulam, neque versus meridiem Arabiam Eudaemon<em>, quae est ultra Persicum mare circa Indicum sinum, ac Troglodyticam regionem ac Nubiam maximam regionem ac ceteras, quae ultra desertum maximum Libyae et Mauritaniae habitant, non acquisiverunt. | 1 § From these, he is called the emperor and lord of the world, capturing the majority name of that world, because the Romans once held the larger part of the world subjugated, not entirely, as they did not conquer Caspian mountains and ports towards Alexandria northward into Scythia, Norway, regions beyond the Caspian Sea, Imaum mountains, Sena kingdom, and also regions beyond the desert Carmania towards India and the Orient, Arachosia and those Indian regions beyond the Indus River and Ganges, and the greatest island Taprobane, nor towards the south Arabia Aegyptus, which lies beyond the Persian Sea around the Indian Gulf, and the Troglodytic region and the largest region of Nubia, and other regions beyond the great Libyan and Mauritanian deserts, inhabited nonetheless. |
| 344 | Quae quidem regiones, ut mihi ex Cosmographia Ptolemaei Claudii constat, non parvam mundi partem, immo paene medietatem terrae habitabilis occupant. | These regions, as known through Ptolemy Claudius’ Cosmographia, indeed constitute not a small but nearly half of the habitable earth. |
| 344 | Sola India enim muratas villas novem milia dicitur continere. | For India alone is said to contain nine thousand walled towns. |
| 344 | Scythia etiam si urbes non habeat, populum tamen maximum habet. | Scythia too, though it lacks cities, has a vast population. |
| 344 | Nubia et Troglodytica regiones, quae ultra solstitialem circulum sunt, habentes utrasque umbras sicut Taprobana insula, non sunt ita inhabitatae propter aestum maximum, neque Norwegia et fines Scythiae propter frigus, tamen multa in eis regna sunt. | Nubia and Troglodytica, regions beyond the tropic, having perpetual shadows like the Taprobane island, are not overly inhabited due to extreme tides, nor Norway and Scythian borders due to cold, yet numerous kingdoms exist there. |
| 345 | Nam Troglodytica regio continet imperium Noges Iohan, quem nos presbyterum Ioannem nominamus, qui Christianus et diaconus esse fidelissimus cum septuaginta subiectis regibus dicitur. | For Troglodytica includes the empire of Noges John, whom we call priest John, who is most faithfully Christian and a deacon with seventy subject kings. |
| 345 | Credo tamen non esse populosa et magna regna. | I believe, however, that there are not many populous kingdoms. |
| 346 | Nulla autem partium orbis tot habet homines sicut Europa secundum suam quantitatem, quoniam non est quarta pars Asiae nec medietas Africae. | No part of the world has as many people as Europe due to its quantity, as it is not a fourth of Asia nor half of Africa. |
| 346 | Incipit autem in Constantinopoli et pertingit ad Gades Herculis ultra Hispaniam, in qua Roma occidentalis civitas situata est, quare occidentale Romanum imperium dicitur et totius mundi, quia gentes illi subiectae maiorem numerum hominum constituebant. | It begins with Constantinople and extends to Cadiz beyond Spain, where the city of Rome in the West is situated, hence the Western Roman empire is called and of the whole world, because the subjugated peoples there constituted a larger number of inhabitants. |
| 347 | Nunc vero videmus ad quid devenit illud admirandum imperium. | Now we see how this admirable empire has evolved. |
| 347 | Oportet itaque dicere [quod], si iure Romani possidebant monarchiam modo dicto, quod tunc imperator, in quem translata est potestas, iure mundi dominus est. | Therefore, we must say that, if the monarchical right of the Romans was held by law as formerly stated, then the then emperor, to whom power has been transferred, is by law the lord of the world. |
| 347 | Si vero imperium non iure nisi ex electiva concordia subiectorum possidetur iuxta praehabita, tunc non est dominus nisi subiectorum actu et oportet intelligere imperatorem dominum illius mundi cui imperat esse. | But if the empire is held not by law but only by elective consensus of the subjugated according to the previously mentioned, then he is not a lord except by the actual subjection of those subjugated, and it must be understood that the emperor is the lord of that world over which he rules. |
| 348 | Capitulum VII. | Chapter VII. |
| 348 | Verum quia excellentia imperialis ex aliqua divina colligantia et approximatione ad deum cunctorum regem constituitur, graduationes consideramus secundum hanc excellentiam secundum accessum et recessum ad ipsum deum, dicendo hunc minimum, qui in publico regimine minus deo assimilatur, hunc maximum, quia plus. | However, since the excellence of imperial dignity is constituted by some divine connection and approach to God of all kings, we consider gradations according to this excellence, by proximity and distance from God, calling him the least who in public governance least resembles God, the greatest who most so resembles. |
| 348 | Et sic rex Tartarorum, quia per leges divinis institutis minime concordantes gubernat, minimus dicitur, rex sectae Mahometanae maior cum, veteris testamenti statuta ac certa novi veneretur, rex Christianorum maximus, cum tam leges naturae quam utriusque testamenti et orthodoxam fidem acceptet. | And thus, the Tartar king, who governs minimally in accordance with divine instituted laws, is considered the least, the greater among the Mahometan sect’s sects, having conformed to statutes and certainties of the old testament and the new, the Christian king is the greatest, accepting both laws of nature and both testaments and orthodox faith. |
| 348 | Et secundum hanc considerationem sacri principatus dico maximam imperii potestatem consistere. | And by this consideration, I say that supreme imperial power resides in sacred principality. |
| 348 | Omnis enim rex et imperator habet officium publicum ad publicam utilitatem ordinatum. | For every king and emperor has a public office ordered for public utility. |
| 348 | Publica vero utilitas est pax, ad quam ordinantur iustitia et iusta proelia. | Public utility consists in peace, which justice and just wars ordain. |
| 348 | Principium autem pacis est ad finem aeternum dirigere subditos, et media illum pertingendi sunt sacra instituta religionum. | The foundation of peace is directing subjects towards eternal ends, and intermediate means are sacred institutions of religions. |
| 348 | Quare prima cura imperialis in hiis observandis versatur. | Thus, the primary concern of imperial care revolves around these. |
| 349 | Ita legimus paganos imperatores pontifices maximos nominari propter curam, quam religioni impendebant. | We read that pagan emperors were often called supreme pontiffs due to their care for religion. |
| 349 | Si igitur haec est principalis cura imperii et ad eam cetera omnia serviunt, non habet dubium ita nostrum Christianum imperium cetera excellere, sicut sanctissima et mundissima nostra religio Christiana in sanctitate et veritate vincit. | If therefore this is the primary concern of imperial rule and all else serves it, it is clear our Christian empire excels in all else, as our Christian religion in sanctity and truth surpasses all others. |
| 349 | Et sicut omnis rex et princeps sui regni identice quoad praescripta curam gerere debet, ita quoad universum Christianum populum imperator. | Just as every king and prince must govern his realm identically regarding prescribed duties, so the emperor regarding the entire Christian populace. |
| 349 | Recte sicut Romanus pontifex primo sui episcopatus, deinde metropolis, post haec patriarchatus et universalis ecclesiae, ultimo curam fidei et quae ad eam spectant gerit, ita imperator curam custodiae gerit primo quoad immediate imperio subiectos, post haec quoad subiectos per medium principum sibi subiectorum immediate, ac deinde quoad subiectos per medium regum et principum proprie sibi non subiectorum, sed lateralia loca sibi vindicantium et eum primum omnium recognoscentium. | As the Roman pontiff first in his own episcopate, then in his metropolis, after that patriarchate and universal church, lastly cares for the faith and what pertains to it, so the emperor first cares for those under immediate imperial rule, then those under immediate rule of intermediate princes subject to him, and lastly those in lateral positions claiming rights and recognized first among all. |
| 350 | Unde sicut princeps, provinciae in temporalibus administrator, curam custodiae gerit dictatorum pro cultu et religione et bono statu rei publicae in provincialibus conciliis et rex in regalibus, quae superius universalia provinciarum plurimum dicuntur, conciliis, ita imperator universalium, quae in universali totius catholicae ecclesiae concilio statuuntur. | Therefore, just as the prince, administrator of the province in temporal matters, carries out the care of custody over the decrees for the sake of worship and religion and the good state of public affairs in provincial councils and the king in royal councils, which are most generally spoken of above in the universal councils of the provinces, so the emperor is the universal one, who is established in the universal council of the entire Catholic Church. |
| 350 | Et oportet quemque principum pro cura illa, quam gerit pro tuenda Christi ecclesia, rationem reddere, 23 q. | And it is necessary for each prince to give an account of the care he carries out for the protection of the Church of Christ. |
| 350 | 5 Dicat et c. | And let him say and c. |
| 350 | Regum et c. | Of kings and c. |
| 350 | Omnes principes. | All princes. |
| 351 | Isto modo imperator dicitur advocatus universalis ecclesiae propter hanc curam protectionis statutorum et custos fidei orthodoxae. | In this way, the emperor is said to be the universal advocate of the Church on account of this care of protection of the statutes and the guardian of Orthodox faith. |
| 351 | Ita legitur Martianum in concilio Calcedonensi custodem fidei appellatum. | Thus it is read of Martian in the Council of Chalcedon, called the guardian of the faith. |
| 351 | Et Basilius imperator in principio octavi concilii universalis dicit sibi divina et benignissima providentia universalis navis fidei gubernacula commissa. | And Basil the emperor, at the beginning of the eighth universal council, says that the divine and most benign providence has committed the rudder of the universal ship of faith to him. |
| 351 | Sicut enim magisterium diffiniendi et statuendi ea, quae ad orthodoxam universalem fidem Christianam spectant, sacerdotio a deo committitur, ita imperio sacro gubernare, confirmare et conservare illa, quae a deo per sacerdotium ordinantur, committitur. | For just as the authority to define and establish those things which pertain to the orthodox universal Christian faith is committed by God to the priesthood, so too is the sacred empire entrusted with governing, confirming, and preserving those things which are ordained by God through the priesthood. |
| 352 | Unde licet Philippus imperator primus fuerit Christianus imperator – vita functus brevi et post tempore parum in universo profecit – et Constantinus imperator licentiam dederit per universum orbem ecclesias aedificandi, et post eum omnes baptizati sint imperatores, licet a fide aberraverint aliqui ut Constantinusmet secundum Hieronymum, Iulianus apostata et Constantius, tamen non fundo tantum imperialem curam quoad fidei custodiam universalem in illa successione, qua imperatores interim successerunt fideles fidelibus, sed in ipsa radicali transfusione potestatis a Christiano Romano populo. | Therefore, although Philip the emperor was the first Christian emperor—his life brief and after a short time he accomplished little in the whole— and although Constantine the emperor gave permission throughout the world to build churches, and after him all emperors were baptized, even though some strayed from the faith, such as Constantine the Second according to Jerome, Julian the Apostate, and Constantius, nevertheless I do not ground the imperial care regarding the universal guardianship of the faith merely in that succession in which emperors succeeded faithful ones, but in the very root transfer of power from the Christian Roman people. |
| 353 | Dico Romanum populum omnem Christianum populum, ut dicit Martianus imperator in Calcedonensi concilio concilii diffinitionem populo Romano profuturam, intelligens per Romanum populum Christianum, quoniam Christiani omnes erant tunc, qui imperio subiacebant. | I say the Roman people as the entire Christian people, as the emperor Martian says in the Chalcedonian council, that the definition of the council would benefit the Roman people, understanding by Roman people the Christian people, because all who were then subject to the empire were Christians. |
| 353 | Unde facto Romano populo Christiano constituti imperatores ab eodem secundum hanc populi qualitatem constituti sunt rectores. | Therefore, when the Roman people became Christian, emperors were constituted by the same, according to this quality of the people, as their rulers. |
| 353 | Ex quo credo hoc verum, quod dicitur in c. | From this I believe the truth is that which is said in c. |
| 353 | Venerabilem De electione, quia populi intentio non est nisi secundum suam qualitatem fidei imperium transfundere in rectorem, quod tunc haereticus non sortiatur potestatem imperii ex electione, sed si papa, qui in episcopatu fidei principatum gerit, electum in fide errare inveniret, declarare posset eum non esse imperatorem. | Venerable is the election, because the people's intention is nothing but to transfer the empire according to their faith in the ruler, so that a heretic would not receive the power of the empire by election, but if the pope, who holds the primacy in the episcopacy of the faith, were to find the elected one erring in faith, he could declare him not to be emperor. |
| 354 | Non tamen nego, quin successio etiam operetur ad hanc curam, ut sicut legimus in variis synodis nominatis imperatoribus fidei custodiendae curam commissam, ita et successoribus. | Yet I do not deny that succession also operates for this care, just as we read in various synods that the care of guarding the faith was committed to the named emperors, so also to their successors. |
| 354 | Propter hoc acclamatum reperio per Calcedonensem synodum Martiano in laudibus: «Novo Constantino aeterna memoria». | For this reason, I find him acclaimed through the Chalcedonian synod in praise: "A new Constantine, eternal memory." |
| 354 | Et in octava synodo ad Basilium dicitur: «Novo Martiano, novo Constantino aeterna memoria. | And in the eighth synod to Basil it is said: "A new Martian, a new Constantine, eternal memory." |
| 354 | » Et per hoc aperta est via investigandi ex vera radice exaltationem imperii Christiani super omnia imperia ac ipsius imperatoris super omnes reges et principes Christianos. | And through this the way is opened to investigate from the true root the elevation of the Christian empire above all empires and of the emperor himself above all Christian kings and princes. |
| 355 | Et quod eapropter, quia universalis fidei custos ac statutorum universalium conservator, quam quidem conservationem absque imperio in cunctos non posset perfecte habere, unde sicut universalia statuta ad fidem catholicam spectantia tam ad ipsius esse conservationem et augmentum universos Christi fideles ligant, ita omnes imperio ad ipsas ordinationes conservando statuto subsunt. | And this is because he is the universal guardian of the faith and the preserver of universal statutes, which preservation he could not fully have without the empire, and so just as the universal statutes concerning the Catholic faith bind all Christ's faithful to their preservation and increase, so all are subject to the empire in order to preserve those very statutes. |
| 356 | Et ideo credo, si imperator conservatorias leges sanctarum harum ad fidem spectantium diffinitionum adderet, sicut Iustinianus, Martianus et alii imperatores fecerunt, quod tunc illae ita universaliter ligarent sicut ipsa principalis, licet aliae leges eos forte non astringerent, qui de facto aut privilegio superioritatem imperii non recognoscunt. | And therefore I believe that if the emperor were to add protective laws concerning the definitions of these holy things which pertain to the faith, as Justinian, Martian, and other emperors did, then those would bind universally just as the principal ones do, although other laws might not bind those who in fact or by privilege do not recognize the superiority of the empire. |
| 357 | Capitulum VIII. | Chapter VIII. |
| 357 | Occasione praemissorum inquirenda sunt ista. | In light of the foregoing, these matters are to be investigated. |
| 357 | Primo, quid laici in conciliis sacerdotum possint, et ibi de imperatore, quid in universalibus conciliis inveniatur egisse. | First, what laymen may do in councils of priests, and there concerning the emperor, what is found to have been done in universal councils. |
| 357 | Post haec de concilio imperiali omnium subiectorum sibi et de eius utilitate aliquid subiungetur. | After this, something will be added regarding the imperial council of all those subject to him and its usefulness. |
| 357 | Et ultimo de reformatione imperii aliqua cogitata explicabuntur. | And finally, some thoughts on the reform of the empire will be explained. |
| 357 | Superius habetur, quomodo laici in universali synodo invitati ad audiendum intersunt et se gestis ut testes subscribunt. | It is held above how laymen are invited to be present to listen in a universal synod and to subscribe their names as witnesses to what is done. |
| 358 | De synodo sacerdotum parochialium non est dubium laicos accusari posse et eos ad defendendum se admitti debere iuxta diffinita in Moguntinensi concilio. | There is no doubt that laymen can be accused and must be admitted to defend themselves in a synod of parish priests, according to the definitions in the Council of Mainz. |
| 358 | Sed in alia synodo, ubi ea, quae sunt canonica et regularia, ventilantur et examinantur, tunc non debent alii laici, quos non decet esse perspectores earum rerum, quae sacerdotibus saepe accidunt, iuxta diffinitionem universalis concilii superius positi nisi fuerint vocati interesse, ut in sexto c. | But in another synod, where canonical and regular matters are discussed and examined, then other laymen, who are not fit to be spectators of those things which often happen to priests, should not be present except when called, according to the definition of the universal council above stated, as in the sixth chapter. |
| 358 | concilii Cabillonensis legitur et in Carthaginensi concilio c. | of the Council of Cahors is read and in the Council of Carthage c. |
| 358 | 119 legitur. | 119 is read. |
| 358 | Principes vero, quando universalia facta sui principatus, non, quando clericorum causae tractantur, adesse possunt, immo et tunc ut auditores, ut hoc in innumeris conciliis legimus et ad petitionem ipsorum legimus, ut frequenter, ipsa congregata. | Princes, however, may be present when matters of their own principality are universal, not when clerical causes are being discussed, but even then as listeners, as we read in innumerable councils and in response to their own petitions, as frequently, the assembly itself. |
| 359 | Legitur enim de Carolomanno rege sic: «Ego Carolomannus dux et princeps Francorum anno ab incarnatione Christi 752 X Kalendis Maii cum consilio servorum dei et optimatum meorum episcopos, qui in meo regno sunt, cum presbyteris in concilium et synodum congregavi, id est Bonifatium archiepiscopum Moguntinum et Burcardum Wormatiensem, ut mihi consilium darent, quomodo lex dei et ecclesiastica religio recuperaretur, et per consilium sacerdotum et optimatum meorum ordinavimus per civitates episcopos et constituimus super eos Bonifatium, qui est legatus sancti Petri. | For it is read of King Carloman thus: "I Carloman, duke and prince of the Franks, in the year 752 of the Incarnation of Christ, on the tenth day before the Kalends of May, with the counsel of the servants of God and my nobles, I convened bishops who are in my kingdom with priests into a council and synod, that is, Boniface, archbishop of Mainz, and Burcard, bishop of Worms, so that they might give me counsel how the law of God and ecclesiastical religion might be recovered, and by the counsel of priests and my nobles we ordered bishops to be appointed in the cities and we established Boniface over them, who is the legate of Saint Peter. |
| 359 | » Et infra: «Statuimus per annos singulos synodum congregari, ut nobis praesentibus canonum decreta et ecclesiae iura restaurentur et religio Christiana emendetur, et fundatas ecclesiarum pecunias ecclesiis restituimus, falsos presbyteros et adulteros et fornicatores diaconos et clericos de pecuniis ecclesiarum abstulimus et degradavimus et ad paenitentiam cogimus. | And below: "We decreed that a synod should be convened every year, so that with us present the decrees of the canons and the rights of the Church might be restored and Christian religion amended, and we restored the funds of the churches to the churches, removed and degraded false priests and adulterers and fornicators from the church funds and compelled them to repent. |
| 359 | » Et infra: «Decrevimus iuxta sanctorum canones, ut unusquisque presbyter episcopo subiectus sit illi, in cuius parochia habitat, et semper in quadragesima rationem ministerii sui sive de baptismo sive catholica fide sive de precibus et ordine missarum episcopo reddat. | And below: "We decreed according to the holy canons that each priest should be subject to the bishop in whose parish he dwells, and always in Quadragesima he should give an account of his ministry, whether of baptism or of the Catholic faith or of prayers and the order of Masses, to the bishop. |
| 359 | Et quocumque iure canonico episcopus circumeat parochiam ad populos confirmandos, presbyter semper paratus sit ad suscipiendum episcopum cum collatione et adiutorio populi, qui ibi debet confirmari. | And wherever a bishop circumvents the parish canonically to confirm the people, the priest should always be ready to receive the bishop with a collation and the assistance of the people who are to be confirmed there. |
| 359 | Statuimus secundum canonicam sanctionem episcopos et presbyteros, undecumque veniant, ad ecclesiasticum ministerium ante synodalem probationem non admitti. | We decreed according to canonical sanction that bishops and priests, wherever they come from, should not be admitted to the ecclesiastical ministry before synodal probation. |
| 359 | Item statuimus, ut quisque servorum dei vel ancillarum Christi in crimine fornicationis lapsus fuerit, quod in carcere paenitentiam faciat in pane et aqua. | We also decreed that whoever of the servants of God or of Christ's handmaidens has fallen into the crime of fornication should do penance in prison on bread and water. |
| 359 | Et si ordinatus presbyter fuerit, duos annos in carcere maneat et ante flagellatus et excorticatus videatur. | And if he is an ordained priest, he should remain in prison for two years and before that be whipped and flayed. |
| 359 | Si vero fuerit clericus vel monachus, post tertiam verberationem in carcerem adeat per annum permansurus. | If, however, he is a cleric or a monk, after the third whipping he should enter prison and remain there for a year. |
| 359 | Similiter et dominae nonnae velatae eadem paenitentia contineantur, et radantur omnes capilli capitis eius. | Similarly, ladies who are veiled nuns should undergo the same penance, and all the hair of their head should be shorn. |
| 360 | Fecit alia synodus, in qua idem interfuit Carolomannus, statutum contra fornicarios sub poena privationis beneficii, et quod ad paenitentiam redigi deberent et alibi locari, et plura alia, et de hac praefata synodo Zacharias papa scribit Bonifatio archiepiscopo in epistulis duabus, quarum una incipit Susceptis et alia Suscipientes sanctissime. | Another synod, in which the same Carloman was present, made a statute against fornicators under the penalty of deprivation of benefice, and that they should be reduced to penance and placed elsewhere, and many other things, and of this aforementioned synod, Pope Zacharias writes to Archbishop Boniface in two letters, one beginning Susceptis and the other Suscipientes sanctissime. |
| 361 | Ecce regem congregare concilium et, quae sunt iusta, cum aliis ordinare. | Behold the king assembling a council and ordering what is just with others. |
| 361 | Et utinam ad hoc hodie principes etiam operam darent, ut publica et mala vitia tollerentur et maxime scandala magna in religione facientia, ut sunt fornicationes earum personarum, quae castitatem voverunt, inter quae de nonnis et earum custodia cura adhiberi deberet. | And would that today the princes also would give their efforts to this, that public and evil vices might be removed, and especially great scandals causing offense in religion, such as the fornications of those persons who have vowed chastity, among which care should be taken concerning nuns and their guardianship. |
| 361 | Nam ille sanctus Bonifatius scribit Ethebaldo Anglorum regi quod apud Graecos et Romanos quasi blasphemiam deo irrogasset, qui de hoc reus foret, ut cum nonna concubuisset. | For that holy Boniface writes to King Ethelbald of the Angles that he had incurred, as it were, blasphemy against God among the Greeks and Romans, whoever should be guilty of this, that he had lain with a nun. |
| 362 | Capitulum IX. | Chapter IX. |
| 362 | Dare itaque debent reges et principes ad tales synodos congregandas operam iuxta ammonitionem sancti Gregorii ad Theodoricum regem Francorum ex Registro c. | Therefore kings and princes ought to give their efforts to the assembling of such synods, according to the admonition of Saint Gregory to King Theodoric of the Franks from the Register, chapter. |
| 362 | 273: «Iterata vos per vestram mercedem adhortatione pulsamus, ut congregari synodum iubeatis et, sicut dudum scripsimus, corporalia sacerdotum vitia et simoniacae haeresis pravitatem omnium episcoporum diffinitione dampnari atque a regni vestri amputari finibus faciatis. | 273: "We urge you repeatedly by our repeated exhortation, that you order a synod to be assembled and, as we wrote some time ago, that the bodily vices of the priests and the wickedness of the simoniacal heresy be condemned by the definition of all the bishops and be removed from the boundaries of your kingdom." |
| 362 | » Haec ille. | Thus he. |
| 363 | Habet etiam exarchus sive princeps monere per se vel alium concilium, ut ea, quae ad pacem ecclesiarum sunt, ordinentur, 23 q. | The exarch or prince also has the power to admonish, either in person or through another, a council, that those things which pertain to the peace of the churches may be ordered, 23 q. |
| 363 | 4 Sicut. | 4 As. |
| 363 | Et si illa concilia principum, quae per Gallias et Alemannias per reges Francorum Aquis, Agrippinae, Confluentiae, Moguntiae et aliis locis celebrata sunt, enumerare vellemus, longum et inutile foret, quia nullus ignorat, cum quanta sollicitudine et studio bonum publicum, veram et puram religionem ipsi sancti principes procurarunt. | And if we wished to enumerate those councils of princes which were celebrated throughout Gaul and Germany by the Frankish kings at Aix-la-Chapelle, Cologne, Coblenz, Mainz, and other places, it would be lengthy and useless, because no one is ignorant with how much solicitude and zeal those holy princes procured the common good, true and pure religion. |
| 363 | Quae quidem omnia et communia bona publica nullibi melius quam in sacris conventibus, ubi omnia per concordantiam tractantur, statui ordinarive possunt. | Which indeed all common and public goods can nowhere be better established or ordered than in sacred assemblies, where all things are treated by agreement. |
| 364 | Est etiam principum officium confirmare et custodire in conciliis diffinita. | It is also the duty of princes to confirm and guard what has been defined in councils. |
| 364 | Unde legitur de Recaredo rege Galliae et Hispaniae sic: «Gloriosissimus dominus rex universorum Recaredus sub regimine nostrae potestatis consistentium. | Whence it is read concerning King Recared of Gaul and Spain thus: "The most glorious lord king Recared, of all those who are under the rule of our power. |
| 364 | Amatores nos vestri divina faciens veritas nostris principaliter sensibus inspiravit, ut causa instaurandae fidei ac disciplinae ecclesiasticae episcopos omnes Hispaniae nostro praesentari culmini iuberemus. | Divine truth, making us your lovers, has inspired our minds principally, that we should order all the bishops of Spain to be presented to our summit for the sake of restoring faith and ecclesiastical discipline. |
| 364 | Procedente autem diligenti et cauta deliberatione, sive quae ad fidem conveniunt, sive quae ad morum correctionem respiciunt, sensus maturitate et intelligentiae gravitate constant esse gesta. | Moreover, proceeding with diligent and cautious deliberation, whether those things which pertain to faith, or those which look to the correction of morals, are shown to have been done with maturity of judgment and weight of intelligence. |
| 364 | Nostra proinde auctoritas hoc omnibus hominibus ad regnum nostrum pertinentibus iubet, ut, si qua diffinita sunt in hoc sancto concilio Toletano anno regni nostri feliciter quarto, nulli contempnere liceat, nullus praeterire praesumat. | Therefore our authority orders all men pertaining to our kingdom, that if anything has been defined in this holy Toletan council in the fourth year of our reign happily, let no one dare to despise it, let no one presume to disregard it. |
| 364 | Capitula enim, quae sensibus nostris placita et disciplinae congrua a praesenti conscripta sunt synodo, in omni auctoritate sive clericorum sive quorumcumque hominum observentur et maneant, id est de observatione priorum canonum. | For the chapters which have been written by the present synod, pleasing to our senses and suitable to discipline, shall be observed and remain in all authority, both of the clergy and of all men whatsoever, that is, concerning the observance of the former canons. |
| 365 | Et infra: «Has omnes constitutiones ecclesiasticas, quas summatim breviterque perstrinximus, sicut plenius in canone continentur, manere perenni stabilitate sanximus. | And below: "We have sanctioned all these ecclesiastical constitutions, which we have briefly summarized, to remain with perpetual stability, as they are more fully contained in the canon." |
| 365 | Si quis ergo clericus vel laicus harum sanctionum oboediens esse noluerit, si episcopus, presbyter, diaconus aut clericus fuerit, ab omni concilio excommunicationi subiaceat. | If therefore any cleric or layman shall be unwilling to be obedient to these sanctions, if he shall be a bishop, priest, deacon, or cleric, let him be subject to excommunication from every council. |
| 365 | Si vero laicus fuerit et honestioris loci persona, medietatem facultatum suarum amittat fisci viribus profuturam. | But if he shall be a layman and a person of higher rank, let him lose half of his possessions, which shall go to the treasury. |
| 365 | Si vero minoris loci persona est, amissione rerum suarum mulctatus in exsilium deputetur. | But if he is a person of lower rank, let him be punished by the loss of his possessions and be banished. |
| 365 | » Haec ibi. | " Thus there. |
| 365 | Consimilia multa adducere possem, si opus foret. | I could adduce many similar things, if it were necessary. |
| 365 | Est itaque hoc notandum, quod reges et principes acta conciliorum custodire, confirmare exsequique debent secundum quod in ipsis canonibus mandatur. | Therefore this is to be noted, that kings and princes ought to guard, confirm, and execute the acts of councils according to what is commanded in the canons themselves. |
| 366 | Capitulum X. | Chapter X. |
| 366 | Ad ista autem concilia reges et principes cum omni mansuetudine, reverentia et humilitate cum dulcibus exhortationibus accedere debent. | Moreover, kings and princes ought to approach these councils with all gentleness, reverence, and humility, with sweet exhortations. |
| 366 | Unde legitur de eodem Recaredo in alio concilio Toletano. | Whence it is read concerning the same Recared in another Toletan council. |
| 366 | Cum pro fidei suae sinceritate idem gloriosissimus princeps omnes regiminis sui pontifices in unum convenire mandasset, princeps sic concilium alloquitur: «Non incognitum reor esse vobis, reverendissimi sacerdotes, quod propter instaurandam disciplinae ecclesiasticae formam ad nostrae vos serenitatis praesentiam evocaverim. | When the same most glorious prince, for the sincerity of his faith, had commanded all the pontiffs of his realm to come together as one, the prince thus addresses the council: "I do not think it is unknown to you, most reverend priests, that I have summoned you to the presence of our serenity for the sake of restoring the form of ecclesiastical discipline. |
| 366 | Et quia decursis retro temporibus haeresis imminens in tota ecclesia catholica agere synodica negotia denegabat, deus, cui placuit per nos eius haeresis obicem depellere, admonuit instituta de more ecclesiastico reparare. | And because in times past the imminent heresy denied the carrying out of synodal business in the whole Catholic Church, God, who was pleased to repel the obstacle of that heresy through us, admonished us to repair the institutions according to ecclesiastical custom. |
| 366 | Ergo sit vobis iucunditas, sit gaudium, quod mos canonicus profectu dei per nostram gloriam ad paternos reducitur terminos. | Therefore let there be joy for you, let there be gladness, that the canonical custom, by the progress of God through our glory, is being restored to its paternal limits. |
| 366 | Prius tamen admoneo pariter et exhortor ieiuniis vos, vigiliis et orationibus operam dari, ut ordo canonicus, quem a sacerdotalibus sensibus detraxerat longa ac diurna oblivio, quem aetas nostra se nescire fatetur, divino rursus vobis dono patefiat. | But first I admonish and exhort you alike to give your efforts to fasts, vigils, and prayers, that the canonical order, which long and daily forgetfulness had taken away from priestly minds, which our age confesses itself not to know, may again be revealed to you by divine gift. |
| 366 | » Ad haec autem gratias deo agentes et gloriosissimo principi universum concilium in laudibus cepit acclamare. | " To these things, giving thanks to God and to the most glorious prince, the whole council began to acclaim in praises. |
| 367 | Triduanum est exinde praedicatum ieiunium. | A three-day fast was then proclaimed. |
| 367 | Et cum die octavo Iduum Maiarum in unum coetum sacerdotes dei adessent et oratione praemissa unusquisque sacerdotum congruo loco resedisset, ecce in medio eorum affuit serenissimus princeps seque cum dei sacerdotibus orationi communicans divino deinceps flumine plenus sic alloquendum exorsus est dicens: «Non credimus vestram latere sanctitatem, quanto tempore in errore Arianorum laboravit Hispania, et non multos post discessum genitoris nostri dies, quibus nos vestra beatitudo fidei sanctae catholicae cognovit esse sociatos, credimus generaliter magnum et aeternum gaudium habuisse. | And when on the eighth day of the Ides of May the priests of God were present in one assembly, and after prayer each priest had sat down in his proper place, behold, in the midst of them was the most serene prince, communicating himself with the priests of God in prayer, and then full of the divine stream, he began to speak, saying: "We do not believe that your holiness is unaware how long Spain labored in the error of the Arians, and not many days after the departure of our father, by which your blessedness has known us to be associated with the holy Catholic faith, we believe that you have had a great and eternal joy generally. |
| 367 | Et ideo, venerandi patres, ad hanc vos peragendam congregavimus synodum. | And therefore, venerable fathers, we have assembled you to this synod to be performed. |
| 368 | Et infra: «Quamvis deus omnipotens pro utilitate populorum regni nobis culmen subire tribuerit et moderamen gentium non paucarum regiae nostrae curae commiserit, meminimus tamen nos mortalium condicione perstringi nec posse felicitatem futurae beatitudinis aliter promereri, nisi nos cultum verae fidei reputemus et conditori nostro salutis confessione, qua dignus est ipse, placeamus. | And below: "Although Almighty God has granted us to attain the summit for the benefit of the peoples of the kingdom, and has committed the governance of not a few nations to the care of our royalty, nevertheless we remember that we are bound by the condition of mortals, and cannot merit the happiness of future blessedness otherwise, unless we consider the worship of the true faith and please our creator with a confession of salvation worthy of him. |
| 368 | Pro qua re, quanto subditorum gloria regali excellimus, tanto providi esse debemus in iis, quae a deo sunt, vel nostram spem agere vel gentibus nobis a deo creditis consulere. | For which reason, by how much we excel in royal glory over our subjects, by so much ought we to be provident in those things which are of God, either to pursue our hope or to consult for the nations entrusted to us by God. |
| 368 | Ceterum quid pro tantis beneficiorum collationibus omnipotentiae divinae valeamus tribuere, quando omnia ipsius sunt et bonorum nostrorum nihil egeat, nisi ut in eum sic tota devotione credamus, quemadmodum per scripturas sacras se ipse intelligi voluit et credi praecepit, id est confitemur. | Moreover, what can we give to the omnipotence of the divine being for the bestowal of so many benefits, when all things are his and he needs nothing of our goods, except that we believe in him with such wholehearted devotion, as he himself wished to be understood and commanded to be believed through the sacred scriptures, that is, we confess. |
| 369 | Et infra: «Proinde, sanctissimi patres, has nobilissimas gentes, quae lucris per nos dominicis applicatae sunt, quasi sanctum et placabile sacrificium per nostras manus aeterno deo offero. | **Et infra:** And below. |
| 369 | Erit enim mihi immarcescibilis corona vel gaudium in retributione iustorum, si populi, qui nostra ad unitatem ecclesiae solertia transcurrerunt, fundati in eadem stabiliti permaneant. | **Proinde:** Therefore. |
| 369 | Sicut enim divino nutu nostrae curae fuit hos populos ad unitatem Christi ecclesiae protrahere, ita sit vestrae docibilitatis catholicis eos dogmatibus instituere, quo in tota cognitione veritatis instructi noverint ex toto errores perniciosos exspuere et verae fidei tramitem ex caritate retinere vel catholicae ecclesiae communionem desiderio avidiore complecti. | **Sicut:** As. |
| 369 | Ceterum sicut facile ad veniam pervenire confido, quod nescia hucusque tam clarissima erraverit gens, ita gravius esse non dubito, si agnitam veritatem dubio corde teneat atque a potenti lumine, quod absit, oculos suos avertat. | **Erit:** It will be. |
| 369 | Unde valde necessarium esse perspexi vestram in unum convenire beatitudinem, habens sententiae dominicae fidem, qua dicit: Ubi fuerint duo vel tres collecti in nomine meo, ibi ero in medio eorum. | **Ut:** In order that. |
| 369 | Credo enim beatam sanctae trinitatis divinitatem huic sancto interesse concilio et ideo, tamquam ante conspectum dei, ita in medio vestri fidem meam protuli. | **In hac:** In this. |
| 369 | » Haec ille. | **Ille:** He. |
| 370 | Discant hic universi reges sacra concilia venerari et sollicitare eorum frequentiam ac humilitatem in exhortatione exhibere sanctis episcopis. | **Ut:** In order that. |
| 370 | Discant sancti episcopi devote cum regibus se habere, quoniam per regem bonum ecclesia Christi crescit secundum magnitudinem potentiae eius. | **Quod:** That which. |
| 371 | Adhuc aliud subiungam Sisenandi regis exemplum. | **In hoc:** In this. |
| 371 | Dum studio amoris Christi anno eiusdem 581 ac diligentia religiosissimi Sisenandi regis Hispaniae atque Galliae in Toletana urbe sacerdotes convenissent, rex ipse, dum in basilica sanctae martyris Leocadiae omnium coetus adesset, pro merito fidei suae cum magnificentissimis et nobilissimis viris ingressus primum coram sacerdotibus dei humi prostratus cum lacrimis et gemitibus pro se interveniendum domino postulavit. | **Dum:** While. |
| 371 | Deinde religiosa prosecutione synodum exhortatus est, ut paternorum decretorum memores ad confirmanda iura ecclesiastica studium praeberent et illa corrigere, quae, dum per negligentiam in usum venerunt, contra ecclesiasticos licentiam sibi de usurpatione fecerunt. | **Et:** And. |
| 371 | Et in fine concilii illius, cui Isidorus interfuit, dicunt episcopi: «Gloria et honor omnipotenti deo nostro, in cuius nomine congregati sumus. | **In hoc:** In this. |
| 371 | Post haec pax, salus et diuturnitas piissimo et amatori Christi domino nostro Sisenando regi, cuius nos devotio ad decretum hoc salutiferum convocavit. | **Et:** And. |
| 371 | Corroboret Christi gloria regnum illius, protegat illum usque ad ultimam senectutem summi dei gratia. | **In hoc:** In this. |
| 371 | Et post praesentis regni gloriam ad aeternum regnum transeat, ut sine fine regnet, qui in saecula feliciter imperat, ipso praestante, qui est rex regum et dominus dominorum. | **Et:** And. |
| 372 | Sic legitur Chintilanum regem in concilium aliud Toletanum cum optimatibus et senioribus palatii sui intrasse suppliciter se orationibus sacerdotum commendante et quod suos fideles ita facere sancta exhortatione coegit atque hanc constitutionem, quam ex praecepto eius concilium decrevit, divina inspiratione praemisit, ut per totum regnum suum perpetuo a die Iduum Decembrium litania triduana servetur. | **Sic:** Thus. |
| 373 | Ecce nunc reges intelligite, ex hiis exemplis erudimini, qui iudicatis terram. | **Et:** And. |
| 373 | Ita enim serviendum est deo in timore, cui exaltandum cum tremore. | **Ut:** In order that. |
| 373 | Omnes reges hunc morem semper habuere, ut aliquos priscos eligerent fama et vita clarissimos, quos sequerentur. | **Et:** And. |
| 373 | Sequimini quoad synodicas observantias praefatas, et feliciter vivetis. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Capitulum XI. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Attendite itaque ad exhortationem sancti Gregorii papae ad Hilpertum regem Francorum, c. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | 264, qui dicit: «Propter hoc omnipotens deus bonos ad populorum regimina perducit, ut per eos omnibus, qui praelati fuerint, dona suae potestatis impendat. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Quod in Anglorum gente factum cognovimus, cui vestra gloria idcirco praeposita, ut bona, quae nobis concessa sunt, etiam subiectae vobis genti superno beneficio restaurentur. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Et ideo, gloriose fili, eam quam accepisti divinitus gratiam sollicita mente custodi, Christianam fidem in populis tibi subditis extendere festina, zelum rectitudinis tuae in eorum conversione multiplica, idolorum cultus insequens fanorum aedificia evertere, subditorum mores in magna vitae munditia exhortando, terrendo, corrigendo et boni operis exempla monstrando aedifica, ut illum retributorem invenias in caelo, cuius nomen atque cognitionem dilataveris in terra. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Ipse enim vestrae quoque gloriae nomen etiam posteris gloriosius reddet, cuius vos honorem quaeritis et reservatis in gentibus. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Si enim Constantinus piissimus imperator Romanam rem publicam a perversis idolorum cultibus revocans omnipotenti deo domino nostro Iesu Christo secum subdidit seque cum subiectis populis tota mente ad deum convertit, unde factum est, ut antiquorum principum nomen suis vir ille laudibus vinceret et tanto in opinione praedecessores suos, quanto in bono opere superaret. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | Et nunc utique vestra gratia cognitionem unius dei patris, filii et spiritus sancti regibus et populis sibimet subiectis festinet infundere, ut antiquos gentis suae reges laudibus ac meritis transeat et, quanto in subiectis suis etiam aliena peccata deterserit, tanto etiam de peccatis propriis ante omnipotentis dei terribile examen securior fiat. | **Et:** And. |
| 374 | » Haec ille. | **Et:** And. |
| 375 | Ecce officium regis est fidem catholicam dilatare in subiectis et per hoc nomen gloriosum acquirere. | **Et:** And. |
| 375 | Multas tales instructiones Isidorus ponit, et aliqua de suis dictis 23 q. | **Et:** And. |
| 375 | 5 habentur, et ad istam tendit conclusionem, quod deus est auctor potestatis regiae, et illa sua potestate rex propter demerita populi permissione divina saepe abutitur. | **Et:** And. |
| 375 | A deo vero regia potestas creditam ecclesiae sanctae commissionem recipit, cuius rationem reddere tenetur, quare legibus fidei omnes sunt astricti. | **Et:** And. |
| 375 | Non debet se solutum legibus aestimare rex, quia, si lex iusta est, tunc ligat et non aliter, quare et ipsum regem, qui iustitiae subest. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Capitulum XII. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Est etiam istud in summa sciendum, quod studium regentis debet esse, ut per concordiam leges ordinet. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Unde opportunum est in concilio utriusque status primatum et praesulum cuncta universalia rem publicam tangentia statui et ordinari. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Illius vero sic per concordiam constituti exsecutor rex esse debet, quoniam est ipsa constitutio regula, secundum quam subiecti potestatem regis ordinatam esse volunt. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Regulari autem per concordiam capitis et membrorum praesidentialem potestatem pro bono rei publicae nemo dubitat concilium universale posse. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Et licet rex dispensare aut interpretari nihilominus ipsam sic conditam legem in dubiis occurentibus pro bono publico et ad finem iustitiae possit per epikeiam virtutem, tamen hoc suo modo, sicut in Romano pontifice et canonibus supradictum est, intelligi debet. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Non quod rex tollere legem sic editam possit absque concilio, quae cum concilio edita est, sed declarare rationem legis in occurrenti casu locum sibi minime vindicare. | **Et:** And. |
| 376 | Et haec sufficiunt ad sciendum, quomodo in synodicis congregationibus officium regis est concurrere, exhortari, confirmare et ecclesiasticis constitutionibus, quae vel ad fidem vel divinum cultum spectant, oboedire et exsequi. | **Et:** And. |
| 377 | In vero publicum statum concernentibus simul statuere debet et ita se habere, sicut recte de metropolitano dictum est superius, qui caput sui concilii est et sine consensu suffraganeorum nihil universam provinciam concernens statuere potest. | In matters concerning the public state, it ought to be established simultaneously and in such a manner, just as was correctly stated above regarding the metropolitan, who is the head of his council and cannot establish anything concerning the entire province without the consent of the suffragans. |
| 377 | Quoniam praesidere debet rex in illo concilio, ubi ista, quae ad regimen rei publicae spectant, et cum consilio optimatum et etiam episcoporum subiectorum per consensum cuncta digeste ordinare. | For the king ought to preside over that council, where those things that pertain to the governance of the republic are discussed, and with the counsel of the optimates and also the subject bishops, he should ordain everything through consensus. |
| 378 | Habere quippe debet princeps ex omnibus de subiectis viros perfectos ad hoc de omni parte regni electos, qui in cotidiano consilio assint regi. | The prince ought to have from all his subjects perfect men, elected from every part of the kingdom, who assist the king in daily counsel. |
| 378 | Tales quippe consiliarii vicem gerere debent omnium regnicolarum, sicut de cardinalibus quodam loco, qui Romano pontifici astant, supradictum est. | Such counselors ought to act in place of all the kingdom's inhabitants, just as was stated above in a certain passage regarding the cardinals, who assist the Roman pontiff. |
| 378 | Et hii tales consiliarii eorum, quos repraesentant, bonum publicum debent continue defensare et avizare et medium proportionatum esse, per quod rex gubernet et influat sibi subiectis, et per quod subiecti refluant in opportunis ad principem. | And these counselors ought to continually defend and advise the public good of those they represent, and be a medium proportion, through which the king governs and influences his subjects, and through which the subjects return to the prince in opportune times. |
| 378 | Et in hoc cotidiano consilio magna vis regni consistit. | And in this daily counsel, the great power of the kingdom consists. |
| 378 | Deberent quidem isti consiliarii in universali congregatione regni concorditer ad hoc deputari et per leges et iuramenta ad bonum publicum persuadendum palam obligari. | These counselors ought to be appointed in a universal congregation of the kingdom, and through laws and oaths, they ought to be openly obligated to persuade the public good. |
| 378 | Et quia de regimine rei publicae sanctus Thomas, Aegidius de Roma, Sedulius Scotus et ante illos Plato et Tullius, licet illi ultimi libri non habeantur, ac etiam alii plures magna volumina nobis reliquere, ad ista quisque recurrat in residuo. | And since Saint Thomas, Aegidius of Rome, Sedulius Scotus, and before them, Plato and Tullius, although the last-mentioned books are not available, and also many others have left us large volumes, let each person refer to these in what remains. |
| 379 | Nunc de imperatore videndum, quid in universali concilio catholicae ecclesiae inveniatur egisse. | Now, it must be seen what the emperor did in the universal council of the Catholic Church. |
| 380 | Capitulum XIII. | Chapter XIII. |
| 380 | Ex superioribus habetur imperatores sanctos congregationes synodales universalium conciliorum totius ecclesiae semper fecisse. | From the above, it is understood that emperors have always made holy synodal congregations of universal councils of the entire Church. |
| 380 | Ita ego perlustrans gesta omnium universalium conciliorum usque ad octavum inclusive Basilii tempore celebratum verum esse repperi. | Thus, I, having examined the deeds of all universal councils up to the eighth, which was celebrated in the time of Basil, have found this to be true. |
| 380 | Ita in eadem octava synodo in quinta actione Heliam colendissimum presbyterum et Sincellum throni Hierosolymorum in auditionem omnium affatum legitur: «Scitote, quia in praeteritis temporibus imperatores erant, qui congregabant synodos. | Thus, in the same eighth synod, in the fifth action, it is read that the most venerable priest Helias and Sincellus of the throne of Jerusalem said to the audience of all: "Know that in past times, there were emperors who congregated synods. |
| 380 | Ex toto terrarum orbe vicarios ad huiusmodi dispositionem causarum colligebant. | They gathered vicars from the entire orb of the earth for the disposition of such matters. |
| 380 | Quorum ergo et dei cultor imperator noster universalem hanc synodum fecit. | Therefore, our emperor, a cultivator of God, made this universal synod. |
| 380 | » Haec ibi. | These things are stated there. |
| 380 | Et legi in glossula Anastasii bibliothecarii apostolicae sedis, qui eandem synodum de Graeco transtulit, super eodem dicto, quod universales synodos de omni terra imperatores colligere soliti fuerant. | And I read in the gloss of Anastasius, the apostolic see's librarian, who translated the same synod from Greek, over the same statement, that universal synods were accustomed to be gathered by emperors from every land. |
| 380 | Locales vero numquam eos legitur collegisse. | However, it is read that they never gathered local synods. |
| 380 | Et ad hoc concordat diffinitio canonica eiusdem concilii superius scripta, quae principalem, id est imperatorem, universalibus dicit interesse debere, non aliis. | And the canonical definition of the same council, written above, concurs with this, which says that the principal, that is, the emperor, ought to be interested in universal synods, not others. |
| 381 | Unde breviter dico, quod, sicut praedictum est, [quod] ita se habet imperator ad universalem catholicae ecclesiae synodum, sicut rex ad universalem regni sui. | Whence, I briefly say that, as was predicted, the emperor is related to the universal synod of the Catholic Church, just as the king is to the universal synod of his kingdom. |
| 381 | Non quod coactive, sed exhortatorie colligere debeat, ut synodus Aquileiae tempore sancti Ambrosii decreto imperatorum Theodosii et Valentiniani congregata in epistula eiusdem concilii in principio ponit: «Omnes per principes vocatos, nullum invitum coactum. | Not that he should gather it coercively, but exhortatively, as the synod of Aquileia, in the time of Saint Ambrose, decreed, which was gathered by the emperors Theodosius and Valentinian, as it is stated in the letter of the same council at the beginning: "All were called by the princes, none were forced or coerced. |
| 381 | » Sed solebant per divales sanctiones necessitatem celebrandi concilii aperire patriarchalibus sedibus et diem et locum constituere ac libertatem protectionis absque oppressione vel timore offerre secundum condiciones synodi suprascriptas. | " But they were accustomed to open the necessity of celebrating a council through imperial sanctions to the patriarchal sees, and to establish the day and place, and to offer the freedom of protection without oppression or fear, according to the conditions of the synod mentioned above. |
| 382 | Et ex tali congregatione non recipit synodus iudicii aut constitutionum firmitatem, sed ex omnium consensu in ipsam congregationem et ex vocatorum comparitione et praesentia, ut haec etiam superius discussa sunt. | And from such a congregation, the synod does not receive the firmness of judgment or constitutions, but from the consensus of all in the same congregation, and from the comparison and presence of those called, as these things were also discussed above. |
| 382 | Dum enim instant universalia pericula fidei aut aliqua Christi ecclesiam universam turbantia, tunc vigilare debet ipse imperator et fidei et pacis custos et Romano pontifici primo synodi necessitatem insinuare et eius consensum congregandi concilii in diffinito loco requirere, ad instar sicut fecere imperatores Valentinianus et Martianus ad Leonem papam scribentes sic: «Pro reverenda et catholica religione Christianorum fidei, cuius auxiliis virtutem nostrae potentiae credimus gubernari, tuam sanctitatem principatum in episcopatu divinae fidei possidentem sacris litteris in principio iustum credimus alloquendam, invitantes atque rogantes, ut pro firmitate et statu nostri imperii aeternam divinitatem tua sanctitas deprecetur, ut et tale propositum atque desiderium habeamus, quatenus omni impio errore sublato per celebrandam synodum te auctore maxima pars circa omnes episcopos fidei catholicae fiat ab omni scelere pura et intemerata consistens. | For when universal dangers to the faith or any things disturbing the universal Church of Christ are imminent, then the emperor himself, the guardian of the faith and peace, ought to be vigilant and first insinuate the necessity of a synod to the Roman pontiff, and require his consent to gather a council in a determined place, just as the emperors Valentinian and Martian did, writing to Pope Leo: "For the revered and Catholic religion of the Christians, whose faith we believe governs the virtue of our power, we believe your sanctity, possessing the principality in the episcopate of the divine faith, should be addressed in sacred letters at the beginning, inviting and asking that your sanctity deprecate the eternal divinity for the firmness and state of our empire, so that we may have such a proposal and desire, that with all impious error removed, the greatest part of the Catholic faith may be made pure and unblemished through the celebration of a synod, with you as author. |
| 382 | » Haec illi. | " These things were said to them. |
| 383 | Pari modo legimus dulci invitatione alios imperatores papam et alios patriarchas episcoposque omnes ad synodum universalem semper advocasse. | In a similar manner, we read that other emperors always summoned the pope and other patriarchs and bishops to a universal synod with a sweet invitation. |
| 383 | Legitur enim Martianum Augustum ad Leonem papam praefatum sic scripsisse: «Leoni reverendissimo episcopo ecclesiae civitatis Romae Martianus. | For it is read that Martian Augustus wrote to the aforementioned Pope Leo: "To Leo, the most reverend bishop of the Church of the city of Rome, Martian. |
| 383 | De studio et oratione nostra sanctitas tua non dubitat, quoniam veram Christianorum religionem et apostolicam fidem firmam volumus permanere et ab omni populo pia mente servari. | Your sanctity does not doubt our study and prayer, since we wish the true Christian religion and apostolic faith to remain firm and be served by all people with a pious mind. |
| 383 | Denique sollicitudinem nostrae potentiae ex recta religione et propitiatione salvatoris nostri consistere non ambigimus. | Finally, we do not doubt that the solicitude of our power consists in the right religion and propitiation of our Savior. |
| 383 | Quapropter reverendissimos viros, quos ad nostram pietatem sanctitas tua direxit, libenter et, sicut decebat, animo grato suscepimus. | Therefore, we have gladly and gratefully received the most reverend men, whom your sanctity directed to our piety. |
| 383 | Superest ut, si placuerit tuae beatitudini in hiis partibus advenire et synodum celebrare, hoc facere religionis affectu dignetur. | It remains that, if it pleases your beatitude to come to these parts and celebrate a synod, you should deign to do this with a religious affection. |
| 383 | Nostris utique desideriis vestra sanctitas satisfaciet et sacrae religionis, quae utilia sint, decernat. | Your sanctity will certainly satisfy our desires and decree what is useful for the sacred religion. |
| 383 | Si vero hoc onerosum est, ut tu ad has partes advenias, hoc ipsum nobis propriis tua sanctitas litteris manifestet. | But if this is burdensome, that you come to these parts, your sanctity should manifest this to us in your own letters. |
| 383 | Quatenus in omni oriente et in ipsam Thraciam et Illyricum sacrae nostrae litterae dirigantur, ut quendam diffinitum locum, ubi nobis placuerit, omnes sanctissimi episcopi debeant convenire et, quae Christianorum religioni atque catholicae fidei prosint, sicut sanctitas tua secundum ecclesiasticas regulas diffinivit, sua depositione declarent. | So that our sacred letters may be directed to all the East and to Thrace and Illyricum, that all the most holy bishops should convene in a determined place, as it pleases us, and declare what is beneficial to the Christian religion and the Catholic faith, as your sanctity has defined according to ecclesiastical rules. |
| 383 | » Haec ibi. | " These things are stated there. |
| 384 | Constantinus etiam imperator, tertius huius nominis, qui convocavit sextam synodum anno Christi 686 vel circa, ad Agathonem papam ita scripsit: «Imperator Flavius Constantinus fidelis Sacra Dono sanctissimo et beatissimo archiepiscopo antiquae nostrae Romae. | Emperor Constantine, the third of this name, who convoked the sixth synod in the year of Christ 686 or around that time, wrote to Pope Agatho: "Emperor Flavius Constantine, faithful to the Sacred Donation, to the most holy and blessed archbishop of our ancient Rome. |
| 384 | Per omnia novit vestra paterna beatitudo et plures sanctae vestrae ecclesiae antiquae Romae, quia, ex quo iussit deus principaliter nos imperare, dum multoties voluissent quidam motionem facere de verbis, de quibus est contentio pro dogmate pietatis inter partes tam sanctae vestrae ecclesiae quam huius sanctae magnae dei ecclesiae, hoc prohibuimus fieri tempore non admittente cognoscentes, quod ex particulari contentione non solum unitas fieri non posset, sed magis malum accresceret. | Your paternal beatitude and the many holy churches of your ancient Rome know all things, since, from the time God ordered us to reign, when certain people wished to make a motion about the words, about which there is contention for the dogma of piety between the parts of your holy church and this holy great church of God, we prohibited this from being done, knowing that the time was not suitable, recognizing that from particular contention, not only could unity not be made, but rather evil would increase. |
| 385 | Et infra: «Veritas enim deo cara est, et secundum domini vocem: Quicumque voluerit omnium princeps esse, sit omnium minister. | And below: "For truth is dear to God, and according to the Lord's voice: Whoever wishes to be the prince of all, let him be the servant of all." |
| 385 | Et iterum dictum est: In hoc cognoscent omnes, quia mei estis discipuli, si dilectionem habueritis ad invicem. | And again it is said: "By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." |
| 385 | Postquam igitur tempus recipit perfectam congregationem fieri, adhortamur vestram paternam beatitudinem per praesentem nostram piam sacram dirigere viros utiles atque modestos, habentes totius deo inspirante doctrinae et peritiam irreprehensibilem, habentes dogmatum indutos personam vestrae apostolicae sedis eiusque concilii, deferentes et libros, qui oportent proferri, et omnem auctoritatem habentes, quatenus convenientes cum hic posito sanctissimo ac beatissimo patriarcha et Machario, sanctissimo patriarcha Theopolitanae, id est Antiochis, civitatis, perscrutentur cum omni mansuetudine et modestia et per gratiam sancti spiritus veritati insistere et consentire, monitionem habentibus eis, qui huc advenerint ex parte sedis vestrae, per praesentem nostram piam sacram. | Therefore, after the time has received the perfect congregation, we exhort your paternal blessedness to direct, through this present pious and sacred letter, useful and modest men, having irreproachable knowledge and expertise in the entire divine doctrine, clothed in the character of the dogmas of your apostolic seat and of that council, bearing the books that ought to be brought forth, and having all authority, so that, meeting with the most holy and blessed patriarch here present and Macarius, the most holy patriarch of Theopolitana, that is, Antioch, they may investigate with all gentleness and modesty, and through the grace of the Holy Spirit, insist on and consent to the truth, having been admonished by those who have come here on behalf of your seat, through this present pious and sacred letter. |
| 385 | Per deum omnipotentem, non est apud nos partis cuiuslibet favor, sed aequalitatem partibus utrisque conservabimus nullatenus necessitatem facientes in quocumque capitulo eis, qui a vobis dirigentur, quoquo modo, sed omni honore cum competenti munificentia et susceptione dignos eos habebimus. | By God Almighty, there is no favor of any party with us, but we will preserve equal treatment for both parties, imposing no necessity in any chapter on those who will be sent by you, in any way, but we will consider them worthy of all honor, with the appropriate munificence and reception. |
| 385 | Et si quidem utrique convenerint, ecce et bene. | And if indeed both parties agree, behold, it is well. |
| 385 | Sin autem minime convenerint, iterum cum omni humanitate eos ad vos dirigemus, de cetero nos <excusantes in iudicio> dei imminente nobis, iuxta quod constituti sumus servare fidem sanctam et immaculatam, quam percepimus, unoquoque proprio sensu abundante rationem reddituri ante sanctum et terribile tribunal dei nostri. | But if they do not agree at all, we will again send them to you with all humanity, excusing ourselves in the judgment of God, which is imminent for us, according to what we have been constituted to preserve the holy and immaculate faith, which we have received, each one giving an account of their own sense, before the holy and terrible tribunal of our God. |
| 385 | Invitare enim et rogare possumus ad omnem emendationem et unitatem omnium Christianorum, necessitatem vero inferre nullatenus volumus. | For we can invite and ask for every emendation and unity of all Christians, but we do not wish to impose necessity in any way. |
| 386 | Personae vero, quae dirigentur a paterna vestra beatitudine, ita decernat. | The persons, however, who will be sent by your paternal blessedness, let it be decreed thus. |
| 386 | Ex vestra itaque sancta ecclesia, si utique videtur ei, tres personae sufficiant, quod si et plures, quanti ei placuerint, dirigat. | From your holy church, therefore, if it seems good to him, three persons may suffice, but if more, as many as he wishes, let him send. |
| 386 | De concilio vero usque ad duodecim metropolitanos episcopos. | From the council, however, up to twelve metropolitan bishops. |
| 386 | De quattuor vero monasteriis Byzantiis ab unoquoque monachos quattuor. | From the four Byzantine monasteries, four monks from each. |
| 386 | Nam si reciperet tempus, perfectam congregationem studuissemus facere. | For if time had permitted, we would have striven to make a perfect congregation. |
| 387 | Et infra: «Deus autem noster proprio concilio protulit, quod nos differebamus in hoc tempore. | And below: "But our God has brought forth by his own council what we were delaying at this time." |
| 387 | Per omnia iubemus vestram paternam beatitudinem minime effici impedimentum voluntati dei, sed eos dirigere. | In all things, we command your paternal blessedness not to hinder the will of God in any way, but to send them. |
| 387 | Sic enim speramus in eius benignitatem, quoniam, qui voluit huiusmodi capitulum movi in praesenti, per sanctum spiritum concedere habet, ut veritas clareat et instruantur omnes sine schismate atque contentione in veritate. | For thus we hope in his benignity, that he who has willed to move such a chapter at present, will grant through the Holy Spirit, that the truth may be clear and that all may be instructed without schism and contention in the truth. |
| 388 | Et infra: «Omnemque concursum venientium iussimus praebere Theodorum, gloriosissimum patricium et exarchum Christo amabilis nostrae Italiae provinciae, tam in navi quamque in expensis et omni utilitati eorum et, si necessitas exegerit, etiam castellatos dromones praebere ad eorum munimen, ut ex omnibus illaesi et sine periculo deo cooperante iidem ad nos perducantur. | And below: "We have commanded Theodore, the most glorious patrician and exarch of Christ-loving Italy, to provide every assistance to those coming, both in ships and in expenses and in every utility for them, and, if necessity requires, even to provide armed dromones for their protection, so that they may be brought to us safely and without danger, with God's help." |
| 388 | Divinitas te servet per multos annos, sanctissime atque beatissime &laddpater&radd. | May the Divinity preserve you for many years, most holy and blessed father. |
| 389 | Haec epistula in principio sextae synodi, quae per illum facundissimum Leonem de Sicilia papam Romanum, utriusque tam Graecae quam Latinae linguae disertissimum, translata est, scripta invenitur habens graves multas notandas sententias. | This letter is found written at the beginning of the sixth synod, which was translated through that most eloquent Leo, the Roman pope from Sicily, a master of both the Greek and Latin languages, having many grave and noteworthy sentences. |
| 389 | Maxime quomodo imperator ordinationem sacri concilii praecogitare iuxta temporis congruentiam debet et cum omni reverentia advocare et defensare venientes cum praestatione summae libertatis absque partialitate. | Especially how the emperor ought to foresee the ordering of the sacred council according to the congruence of time and to summon and defend those coming with the greatest reverence and the provision of supreme liberty, without partiality. |
| 389 | Aliis vero episcopis legimus consimiliter imperatores scripsisse per suas sacras. | We have read that similar letters were written by emperors to other bishops through their sacred letters. |
| 390 | Unde praefati imperatores Valentinianus et Martianus ita rescripsere: «Omnia ad veram fidem et Christianam orthodoxam religionem tendentia praeponenda aliis rebus existimamus. | Whence the aforementioned emperors Valentinian and Martian wrote: "We consider that all things tending towards the true faith and Christian orthodox religion ought to be preferred to other things." |
| 390 | » Et infra: «Unde tua sanctitas cum quantis approbaverit reverendissimis episcopis sub tuo sacerdotio constitutis sanctarum ecclesiarum, expertes habentibus divinas scripturas et scientiam et doctrinam orthodoxae et verae fidei, prae cunctis eminentibus ad Nicaeam civitatem proxime Kalendis Septembris advenire festinet. | And below: "Whence your sanctity, with as many reverend bishops as you have approved under your priesthood, having expertise in divine scriptures and knowledge and doctrine of orthodox and true faith, hasten to come to Nicaea, near the Kalends of September, surpassing all others." |
| 390 | Quisquis enim generalem et omni mundo utilem futuram synodum refutaverit, peccat equidem et nostram divinitatem offendit. | For whoever refuses a general synod, which will be useful to the whole world, sins indeed and offends our divinity. |
| 390 | Agnoscat autem et tua sanctitas, quoniam nostra pietas aderit in ipso concilio, nisi quaedam publicae et inevitabiles curae nos in expeditum fecerint. | But let your sanctity also know that our piety will be present in the council itself, unless certain public and inevitable cares prevent us. |
| 390 | » Haec illi. | These are their words. |
| 391 | Dicit de Nicaea, quia ad hanc civitatem indixit concilium Valentinianus, sed postea ad Calcedonam est translatum. | He says about Nicaea that Valentinian decreed a council in this city, but afterwards it was transferred to Chalcedon. |
| 391 | Unde ad congregatos in Nicaea iidem scripserunt: «Studii nostri est congruenter decerni ea, quae sanctae et orthodoxae religionis exsistunt, quatenus omnis ambiguitas perimatur et decens pax sanctissimis et catholicis reddatur ecclesiis. | Whence they wrote to those gathered in Nicaea: "It is our study to decree suitably those things which exist for the holy and orthodox religion, so that all ambiguity may be removed and decent peace may be restored to the most holy and catholic churches." |
| 391 | Hoc enim omnibus rebus praeponendum existimamus. | For we consider this to be preferable to all other things. |
| 391 | Quia igitur volumus interesse sancto concilio, retinent vero nos publicae et necessariae utilitates in expedito, dignetur vestra religio non arbitrari grave nostrae tranquillitatis praesentiam sustinere, sed orare, quatenus ea, quae inter manus habemus, deo auxiliante disponentes bene illic venire possimus, ut nostra pietate praesente decernantur, quae omnem discordiam quaestionemque submoveant et confirment veram ac venerandam orthodoxam fidem. | Therefore, since we wish to be present at the holy council, but public and necessary utilities detain us, let your piety not consider it a burden to sustain the presence of our tranquility, but pray that we, disposing of those things which we have in hand with God's help, may come there well, so that, with our piety present, those things may be decreed which will remove all discord and questioning and confirm the true and venerable orthodox faith. |
| 391 | » Haec ibi. | These are the words there. |
| 392 | Post haec scripserunt iidem imperatores, quomodo missi Leonis papae omnino voluerunt eos concilio interesse debere. | After these things, the same emperors wrote how the envoys of Pope Leo wished them to be present at the council. |
| 392 | Et quia commodius possent in Calcedona propter necessitates publicas quam in Nicaea concurrere, scribunt sic: «Unde si perspicit vestra religio, in Calcedonensium civitate venire dignamini. | And because they could more conveniently gather in Chalcedon on account of public necessities than in Nicaea, they write thus: "Whence, if your piety sees fit, deign to come to the city of Chalcedon." |
| 392 | » Et quia dubitabant de securitate propter Eutychetem, miserunt ad impera tores, qui in Thracia fuerunt, hoc eis significantes, qui ad eos rescripserunt plenam securitatem eis promittentes. | And because they were doubting about security on account of Eutyches, they sent to the emperors who were in Thracia, signifying this to them, who wrote back to them, promising full security. |
| 393 | Ex hiis habes quomodo imperatores causas fidei omnibus praeponere debent et omnia cum convenienti reverentia et caritative, quae in synodis fieri habent, expedire, nullam necessitatem inferendo. | From these things, you have how emperors ought to prefer the causes of faith to all other things and to expedite all things with suitable reverence and charity, which are to be done in synods, imposing no necessity. |
| 393 | Et quod concilio interesse debent ad fidem confirmandam, non ad necessitatem inferendam, sicut Martianus imperator Constantinum allegans dixit, 96 di. | And that they ought to be present at the council to confirm the faith, not to impose necessity, as Emperor Martian said, alleging Constantine. |
| 393 | Nos ad fidem. | We are for the faith. |
| 394 | Capitulum XIV. | Chapter XIV. |
| 394 | Etiam ad hoc operam dare debent imperatores et omnes reges sub suo regno synodicas conventiones habentes, ut tumultus omnis vitetur et expellantur expellendi. | Emperors and all kings, holding synodal assemblies within their realms, should also devote themselves to this, so that all tumult may be avoided and those who are to be expelled be expelled. |
| 394 | Unde piissima Pulcheria Augusta ad consularem Bithyniae stratigium, ut curam haberet circa disciplinam synodi, quae in Nicaea congregata et nondum Calcedonam translata erat, scripsit: «Quia secundum nostram sanctionem reverendi episcopi universi convenerunt sustinentes potestatis nostrae praesentiam, quae non post multum deo cooperante aderit, quidam autem, sicut agnovimus, cum sint soliti conturbare et confundere deo placitam disciplinam, supervenientes in Nicaea, clerici atque monachi atque laici, tumultus facere temptant contendentes absque iis, quae nobis placuerunt, necessarie has pias litteras ad tuam direximus claritatem, quatenus cum omni virtute eos, qui praeter nostram evocationem aut permissionem suorum episcoporum ibidem commorantur, clericos, sive inter hunc ordinem constitutos sive aliqui eorum a propriis episcopis sunt remoti, vel monachos atque laicos, quos nulla ratio ad concilium vocat, omni modo debeas civitate et ipsis locis expellere, ut cum omni disciplina consedente sancta synodo sine omni commotione atque contentione, quae a domino Christo revelata fuerint, communiter ab omnibus confirmentur. | Therefore, the most pious Augusta Pulcheria wrote to the consular stratigos of Bithynia, so that he would take care concerning the discipline of the synod, which had assembled at Nicaea and had not yet been transferred to Chalcedon: "Because, according to our sanction, all the reverend bishops have assembled, enduring the presence of our power, which will be present soon, God cooperating, some, however, as we have recognized, being accustomed to disturb and confuse the pleasing discipline of God, coming to Nicaea, clerics and monks and laymen, attempt to cause tumult, contending without those things which we have approved, we have necessarily directed these pious letters to your clarity, so that with all your strength you should expel from the city and those places all those who are there without our summons or the permission of their bishops, clerics, whether constituted in this order or some of them removed by their own bishops, or monks and laymen whom no reason calls to the council, in every way, so that with all discipline, the holy synod sitting in session, without any commotion and contention, what has been revealed by the Lord Christ may be confirmed by all together. |
| 394 | Scito enim quod, si quis de cetero inventus fuerit tumultuosus ibidem commorari aut ante praesentiam nostrae tranquillitatis aut certe post praesentiam, non fortuitum tibi imminere periculum. | For know that, if anyone hereafter is found to be tumultuous, staying there either before the presence of our tranquility or certainly after, no fortuitous danger will threaten you. |
| 394 | » Haec ibi. | "This is there." |
| 395 | Ecce laicos, monachos et &laddclericos&radd, maxime non habentes sui episcopi licentiam, conciliis universalibus interesse non debent. | Behold, laymen, monks, and clerics, especially those not having the license of their bishop, should not attend universal councils. |
| 395 | Omnes enim contentiones cum tumultu pati in conciliis non debent. | For all contentions and tumults should not be tolerated in councils. |
| 395 | Gloriosissimi enim iudices et amplissimus senatus leguntur in prima actione Calcedonensis concilii dixisse, quando impediebatur tumultu lectio gestorum in Epheso: «Acclamationes istae populares neque episcopos decet neque partes iuvant. | For the most glorious judges and the most ample senate are read in the first action of the Chalcedonian council to have said, when the reading of the acts in Ephesus was hindered by tumult: "These popular acclamations are neither fitting for bishops nor do they help the parties." |
| 395 | » De quo in concilio Toletano provisum et de poena in loco benedictionis sedentium et turbantium synodum, scilicet triduana excommunicatione. | "Concerning which, provision was made in the Toletan council, and concerning the penalty for those sitting and disturbing the synod in the place of benediction, namely, a three-day excommunication." |
| 396 | Sic in eisdem gestis Calcedonensis concilii legitur commonitorium ad Helpidium virum spectabilem, comitem sacri consistorii, ab imperatoribus datum pro defensione synodi Ephesinae, ubi sic legitur: «Ideo igitur tam tuam claritatem quam Eulogium, virum spectabilem et tribunum et notarium, ad ministerium elegimus fidei defensandae, sicut probatos in aliis pluribus rebus rectissimosque repertos et circa dei cultum opinatissimos ac valentes nostris diligenter iussionibus ministerium exhibere. | Thus, in the same acts of the Chalcedonian council, a reminder is read, given by the emperors to Helpidius, a distinguished man, count of the sacred consistory, for the defense of the Ephesian synod, where it is read thus: "Therefore, we have chosen both your clarity and Eulogius, a distinguished man and tribune and notary, for the ministry of defending the faith, as having been found tested in many other matters and most upright, and most esteemed and powerful in the worship of God, diligently to carry out our commands." |
| 396 | De hiis vero, quae in Epheso sancta synodo fuerint constituenda, nullum fieri tumultum vos permittere oportet. | Concerning those things which were to be established in the holy synod at Ephesus, you should permit no tumult to occur. |
| 396 | Sed si quem videritis conturbationibus et tumultibus tendentem ad laesionem sanctae fidei, hunc debetis custodiae mancipare et ad nostram perferre notitiam relationibus vestris, ut causa quidem ordine proprio ventiletur. | But if you see anyone tending toward disturbances and tumults to the detriment of the holy faith, you should entrust this person to custody and bring him to our notice in your reports, so that the matter may be investigated in the proper order. |
| 396 | Interesse autem vos oportet iudicio et operam celerem dare, quo circa inspectam probationem sancta synodus fieri sibi cognoscat. | Moreover, you should attend the judgment and give prompt assistance, so that the holy synod may know that the investigation is being carried out. |
| 396 | Vos autem nobis cognitum facite, quaecumque fuerint diffinita. | And you should inform us of whatever has been defined. |
| 397 | Et infra: «Non liceat autem ullum aliud moveri negotium ex pecuniariis videlicet capitulis, antequam ea, quae de fide sunt catholica, effectui mancipentur. | And below: "Moreover, no other business may be moved from the financial chapters, namely, before those things which are of the Catholic faith are carried out." |
| 397 | Ideo namque et civile per litteras, quas ad virum spectabilem proconsulem scripsimus, et reliquis militare vobis auxilium delegavimus, quatenus et vos sive per proprium officium seu hiis fulti auxiliis sufficere possitis ad ea, quae praecepimus adimplenda, quae tanto aliis omibus meliora sunt, quanto solent humanis divina praecellere. | For this reason, both by letter, which we have written to the distinguished proconsul, and by military aid to the rest, we have delegated assistance to you, so that you may be able to suffice either by your own office or by these aids to fulfill what we have commanded, which are so much better than all others, as divine things are usually superior to human." |
| 397 | Et quae in hac causa fuerint constituta, ad nostram perferre notitiam festinate. | And what shall have been established in this matter, bring to our notice quickly. |
| 397 | Eodem tenore Eulogio viro spectabili scriptum est. | The same is written to Eulogius, the distinguished man. |
| 397 | » Haec ibi. | "This is there." |
| 398 | Ecce quomodo imperator sollicitam curam de custodia universalis concilii habere debet et omnino facere, ut tumultus et turbatio nulla fiat et quod decernenda serventur. | Behold how the emperor ought to have careful concern for the protection of the universal council and to do everything so that no tumult or disturbance occurs and that what is to be decreed is preserved. |
| 398 | Ista sunt, quae ad imperatorem spectant quoad synodi principium, scilicet convocare cum exhortatione et tuitione summaque libertate et bona et optima custodia dempta omni partialitate et praecepti necessitate. | These are the things which pertain to the emperor concerning the beginning of the synod, namely, to convene it with exhortation and the utmost freedom and good and excellent protection, removing all partiality and the necessity of command. |
| 399 | Capitulum XV. | Chapter XV. |
| 399 | De convocatione vero dubium ex prioribus, ubi de papa dictum est, quomodo ad eum spectat, oriri posset, sed de reliquis praetactis nemo iuste dubitare poterit. | Concerning the convocation, however, a doubt might arise from the previous passages, where the pope is mentioned, how it pertains to him, but concerning the other matters previously discussed, no one can justly doubt. |
| 399 | Ideo quoad illud discutiendum dicamus, quod hoc interest inter utriusque convocationem, quoniam papa ut primus et habens praeceptivam potestatem ex principatu sacerdotii sui in omnes alios episcopos quoad eam congregationem respicientem universalem ecclesiae statum, in qua ipse primam curam gerit. | Therefore, concerning that, let us say that this is a matter between the convocation of both, because the pope, as first and having prescriptive power from the principality of his priesthood, with respect to all other bishops, concerning that congregation, concerning the universal state of the church, in which he himself holds the first care. |
| 399 | Ex qua credita potestate praecipere habet Christi fidelibus, ut conveniant, maxime subiectis omnibus sacerdotibus. | From which delegated power, he has the right to command the faithful of Christ to convene, especially all subject priests. |
| 399 | Imperator vero exhortatur et persuadet episcopis ac praecipit laicis. | The emperor, however, exhorts and persuades the bishops and commands the laity. |
| 400 | Neque Romanus pontifex dicit convocationem ad eum pertinere tantum, sed quod sine sua auctoritate fieri synodus non debeat. | Nor does the Roman pontiff say that the convocation pertains only to him, but that a synod should not be held without his authority. |
| 400 | Quando itaque imperator ob incumbentem necessitatem ecclesiae primo exhortatur Romanum pontificem et deinde alios, ut conveniant, recte prosequitur viam antiquorum. | Therefore, when the emperor, because of the pressing necessity of the church, first exhorts the Roman pontiff and then the others to convene, he rightly follows the way of the ancients. |
| 400 | Tunc interpellat Romani pontificis primo et deinde aliorum auctoritatem. | Then he appeals to the authority of the Roman pontiff first and then to the others. |
| 400 | Et nisi ita ageret, scilicet si sine vocatione Romani pontificis episcopos congregaret, non esset universalis concilii auctoritas plena iuxta praehabita. | And if he did not act thus, namely, if he assembled the bishops without the summons of the Roman pontiff, the authority of the universal council would not be complete according to the foregoing. |
| 400 | De essentia enim eius est, ut nullus excludatur maxime episcoporum, qui velit et possit interesse. | For its essence is that no one, especially bishops, who wishes and is able to attend, should be excluded. |
| 401 | Igitur hoc indubie in Romano pontifice verum. | Therefore, this is undoubtedly true in the Roman pontiff. |
| 401 | Si vero Romanus pontifex rogatus non mitteret aut non veniret aliis parentibus exhortationi imperiali, non est subito procedendum, nisi necessitas ecclesiae, quae legem non habet, expeditionem desideraret. | But if the Roman pontiff, when asked, does not send or does not come, obeying the imperial exhortation, one should not proceed immediately, unless the necessity of the church, which has no law, desires the expedition. |
| 402 | Verum si congregationi institutae per imperatorem Romanus pontifex contradiceret, nisi ecclesiae necessitas plus parendum imperatori persuaderet, Romano pontifici mos gerendus est. | But if the Roman pontiff were to contradict the congregation instituted by the emperor, unless the necessity of the church persuaded one to obey the emperor more, the custom should be observed toward the Roman pontiff. |
| 402 | Unde non credo etiam absurdum esse illud dictum, quod etiam propter curam commissam custodiendae fidei sacro imperio ipse imperator negligente aut contradicente Romano pontifice imminente magno universali turbationis ecclesiae periculo praeceptive posse synodum indicere ad providendum fluctuanti ecclesiae. | Whence I do not believe it to be absurd to say that even because of the care entrusted to the sacred empire for the preservation of the faith, the emperor himself, if the Roman pontiff is negligent or contradicts, can authoritatively convene a synod to provide for the fluctuating church in the face of great danger of universal disturbance. |
| 402 | Licet enim aut ordo aut positivi iuris determinatio propter conservandam pacem exemerit clericos a potestate imperiali et supraordinaverit etiam ipsi imperio sacerdotium et cunctis Romanum pontificem, tamen, cum cessant omnia illa, propter quae huiusmodi sacra ordinatio instituta est, quoniam omnia propter conservationem ipsius sanctae ecclesiae ita constituta sunt, revertimur tunc ad habendum eundem finem ad aptos congruos modos tempori hoc ordine nobis non serviente minime curato. | For although either order or positive law, for the preservation of peace, may have exempted clerics from imperial power and even placed the priesthood above the empire, and the Roman pontiff, yet, when all those things for which this sacred order was instituted cease, since all these things were so established for the preservation of the holy church itself, we then return to the same end by appropriate and fitting methods, if this order does not serve the time, by no means neglected. |
| 402 | Et haec sufficiant. | And these things suffice. |
| 403 | Capitulum XVI. | Chapter XVI. |
| 403 | Nunc perquiramus ex codicibus sacrorum conciliorum florentissimae quondam ecclesiae, quid conveniat imperatori in concilio congregato cum suis patriciis et senatoribus peragere. | Now let us inquire from the codes of the sacred councils of the formerly flourishing church, what is fitting for the emperor to do in a council assembled with his patricians and senators. |
| 403 | Et primo reperio ex omnium gestis, tam in Calcedona, Constantinopoli, Nicaea et Epheso, quod aut ipse imperator per se interfuit, aut ex eius iussione suum locum tenentes, sacri senatus et iudices, pauci tamen semper ex maximis et principalibus et intelligentibus principibus et non plures viginti umquam interfuisse, immo raro quindecim comperio. | And first I find from the acts of all, both at Chalcedon, Constantinople, Nicaea, and Ephesus, that either the emperor himself was present in person, or by his command his lieutenants, the sacred senate and judges, but few always from the greatest and most important and intelligent princes, and not more than twenty were ever present, indeed, I find rarely fifteen. |
| 403 | Imperatore vero in persona exsistente reperio eum semper praesedisse. | But when the emperor was present in person, I find that he always presided. |
| 404 | In sexta enim synodo tertius Constantinus praesedit in medio cum decem de maioribus patriciis, et ad laevam eius vicarii senioris Romae et Hierosolymorum, ad dexteram vero patriarchae alii, primo Constantinopolitanus, deinde Alexandrinus, post Antiochenus. | In the sixth council, Constantine III presided in the midst of ten of the greater patricians, and on his left were the vicars of the elder Rome and Jerusalem, and on his right the other patriarchs, first the Constantinopolitan, then the Alexandrian, and after him the Antiochene. |
| 404 | Et coniungebantur in qualibet banca episcopi illarum sedium. | And the bishops of those sees were joined together on each bench. |
| 404 | In octava synodo praesidebat Basilius et ad dexteram et secundum ordinem vicarii apostolicae sedis et alii patriarchae. | In the eighth council, Basil presided, and on his right and in order were the vicars of the apostolic see and the other patriarchs. |
| 404 | Verum in Calcedona, quia Martianus imperator in principio non interfuit, senatus et iudices erant in medio, sicut de tertio Constantino dictum est. | But in Chalcedon, because the emperor Marcian was not present at the beginning, the senate and judges were in the middle, as was said of Constantine III. |
| 404 | Et ipse Martianus ad synodum post hoc veniens praesidebat cum paucis de senatu sibi adiunctis lateraliter vicariis apostolicae sedis et patriarchis ut in sexta synodo sedentibus. | And Marcian himself, coming to the council afterward, presided with a few of the senate joined to him, with the vicars of the apostolic see and the patriarchs seated at his sides as in the sixth council. |
| 404 | Basilius vero imperator patriarchalium sedium vicariis et patriarchis in subscriptione se postposuit ex humilitate tota synodo rogante, ut se praeponeret, et ipso ex humilitate renuente, ut dicunt gesta finalia eiusdem synodi. | Indeed, Emperor Basil, out of humility, placed himself after the vicars of the patriarchal sees and the patriarchs in the subscription, though the whole council urged him to place himself first, and he, out of humility, refused, as the final acts of that council say. |
| 405 | Unde quia senatores et patricii ac principes clarissimi, qui sunt pars corporis imperatoris, consueverunt synodis interesse de iussione et mandato imperatoris et non aliter, ut omnia gesta clamant, tunc est hoc notandum, quod nullus saecularis princeps habet ius interessendi concilio universali nisi imperator, alii omnes solum, si iussi ab imperatore fuerint vel sacro concilio. | Therefore, since senators, patricians, and most illustrious princes, who are part of the emperor's body, are accustomed to attend councils by the command and mandate of the emperor and not otherwise, as all the acts declare, it must be noted that no secular prince has the right to attend a universal council except the emperor; all others may do so only if commanded by the emperor or the sacred council. |
| 405 | Illi vero, qui sunt pars corporis eius, sicut sunt patricii, exconsules, exarchi et sacer senatus, ipsi imperatori immediate coniungi debent. | Those who are part of his body, such as patricians, ex-consuls, exarchs, and the sacred senate, ought to be joined immediately to the emperor himself. |
| 406 | Fit itaque iniuria imperatori, si in locatione saecularium principum, qui de iure interesse non habent in universali concilio et quorum ius interessendi ab eius iussione dependet, impeditur. | Therefore, an injury is done to the emperor if the placement of secular princes, who by right do not have the authority to attend a universal council and whose right to attend depends on his command, is hindered. |
| 406 | Ab imperali enim potestate ordinatio talis inter saeculares dependet, qui omnes ei, etiam alias exempti, tunc in concilio subsunt tamquam protectori concilii. | For from the imperial power depends the arrangement among seculars, who all, even if otherwise exempt, are then subject to him in the council as the protector of the council. |
| 406 | Ex qua re in omnes iurisdictionem habet. | From this, he has jurisdiction over all. |
| 406 | Et maxime fit iniuria ipsis sacri imperii electoribus populum Romanum repraesentantibus et sacrum senatum et unum cum imperatore proximae colligationis corpus facientibus, si quisquam absque ordinatione sacrae maiestatis, maxime qui digniori titulo non decoratur, ipsis se praefert, et pro honore sacri imperii et bono publico talis ambitio admitti non deberet. | And especially is an injury done to the electors of the sacred empire, representing the Roman people and the sacred senate, and making one body with the emperor in closest union, if anyone, without the ordination of the sacred majesty, especially one not adorned with a more worthy title, places himself before them, and for the honor of the sacred empire and the public good, such ambition ought not to be admitted. |
| 407 | Capitulum XVII. | Chapter XVII. |
| 407 | Tamen ad hoc, ut de hac re nulla contentio oriatur tamquam de nihilo, sciendum est ipsos laicos principes praetactos, etiam si iussu imperatoris intersint, non habere vocem synodicam, sed solum audire debere. | Yet, to prevent any contention arising from this matter as if it were nothing, it must be known that the aforementioned lay princes, even if they attend by the emperor's command, do not have a synodal voice but should only listen. |
| 407 | Unde ita legitur in gestis octavi concilii quarta actione, quod, cum vicarii senioris Romae loquendo ad principes, qui iussu Basilii interfuerunt, dicerent: «Interrogate illos, magnificentissimi et gloriosissimi principes, an illi, qui introierunt, faciunt libellum hunc» Dixerunt principes: «Ut obsecundantes verbo vestro et praeceptione vestra interrogabimus eos, non per potestatem nostram. | Hence, it is read in the acts of the eighth council, in the fourth session, that when the vicars of the elder Rome, speaking to the princes who attended by Basil's command, said, "Ask them, most magnificent and most glorious princes, whether those who entered make this libel," the princes said, "As we obey your word and your precept, we will ask them, not by our own power. |
| 407 | Potestas enim haec vestra est. | For this power is yours." |
| 407 | » Et in fine dicit Basilius imperator in capitulo, quod incipit Multam quidem, cuius tenor infra ponitur: «Quamquam non sit datum istis secundum canonem dicendi quidquam penitus de ecclesiasticis causis, opus enim hoc pontificum et sacerdotum est. | And at the end, Emperor Basil says in the chapter that begins "Much indeed," the tenor of which is placed below: "Although it is not given to these, according to the canon, to say anything at all about ecclesiastical matters, for this is the work of pontiffs and priests." |
| 407 | » Et loquitur de laicis. | And he speaks of the laity. |
| 407 | Idem Ambrosius 75. | The same Ambrose, in his 75th letter against Auxentius to Emperor Valentinian, says, "If we review the series of divine scriptures or the times of the ancients, who is there who would deny that in matters of faith, bishops are accustomed to judge Christian emperors, not emperors bishops?" |
| 407 | epistula contra Auxentium ad Valentinianum imperatorem dicens: «Si scripturarum seriem divinarum vel veterum tempora retractemus, quis est, qui abnuat in causa fidei episcopos solere de Christianis imperatoribus non imperatores de episcopis iudicare? | And below: "Your father, by God's favor, a man of mature age, said, 'It is not for me to judge among bishops.' |
| 407 | » Et infra: «Pater tuus deo favente vir maturioris aevi dicebat: Non est meum inter episcopos iudicare. | Your clemency now says, 'I ought to judge.' |
| 407 | Tua nunc clementia dicit: Ego debeo iudicare. | And he, baptized in Christ, thought himself unfit for such a weight of judgment." |
| 407 | Et ille baptizatus in Christo inhabilem se tanto ponderi esse putabat iudicii. | These are his words. |
| 407 | » Haec ille. | Behold, concerning matters pertaining to the religion of faith, the emperor ought not to judge among bishops. |
| 408 | Ecce quod de pertinentibus ad fidei religionem inter episcopos imperator iudicare non debet. | The venerable Sedulius writes in his book "On Christian Rulers," chapter 11, that Emperor Valentinian, after this, when asked by the holy bishops to deign to attend for the amendment of sacred dogma, said to the council, "It is not lawful for me, as I am the least of the people, to scrutinize such things. |
| 408 | Scribit autem venerabilis Sedulius in libello De rectoribus Christianis c. | But let the priests, whose care this is, gather among themselves wherever they wish." |
| 408 | 11 ipsum Valentinianum imperatorem post haec, dum a sanctis episcopis rogaretur, quatenus dignaretur ad emendationem sacri dogmatis interesse, synodo dixisse: «Mihi, inquit, cum minimus sim de populo, fas non est talia perscrutari. | And in the sixth council, it is said in the first session: "With the most pious and Christ-loving great emperor Constantine presiding in the secretarium of the sacred palace, and by the command of his God-instructed serenity, Nicetas, the most glorious ex-consul, patrician, and count of the imperial service, being present and listening." |
| 408 | Verum sacerdotes, quorum haec cura est, apud semet ipsos congregentur, ubi voluerint. | And similarly, this is proven in a certain place above, how by the command of the emperor, the patrician Bahanis, speaking on behalf of others, said he attended to listen to the senate. |
| 408 | » Et in sexta synodo dicitur in prima actione: «Praesidente piissimo et Christo dilecto magno imperatore Constantino in secretario sacri palatii et ex iussione eius a deo instructae serenitatis praesentibus et audientibus Niceta gloriosissimo exconsule, patricio et comite imperialis obsequii. | And this is proven by the acts of the Council of Chalcedon, where, after the princes who attended by Marcian's command are named at the beginning, it is added: "With the holy and universal council also convening according to the sacred command in the city of Chalcedon, with Paschasinus and Lucentius, the reverend bishops, and Boniface, the presbyter, holding the place of the most holy and reverend archbishop of the venerable city of Rome, Leo, and with Anatolius, the most reverend bishop of the renowned city of Constantinople." |
| 409 | Et similiter hoc quodam loco superius probatur, quomodo ex iussione imperatoris Bahanis patricius aliorum nomine loquens ad audiendum senatum interesse dixit. | Therefore, if they do not have a voice by right, then those coming only to listen are rightly subject to imperial judgment for the preservation of the council's liberty in all matters concerning the council, without whose command and permission they ought not to attend. |
| 409 | Et hoc probant gesta Calcedonensis concilii, ubi, postquam principes in principio nominantur, qui iussione Martiani interfuere, additur: «Conveniente autem etiam sancto et universali concilio secundum sacram iussionem in Calcedonensem urbem congregato, Paschasino et Lucentio reverendis episcopis et Bonifatio presbytero, tuentibus locum sanctissimi et reverendissimi archiepiscopi almae urbis Romae Leonis, et Anatholio reverendissimo episcopo inclitae urbis Constantinopolitanae. | Therefore, the princes of the world ought to send not laymen but bishops, so that they might also open their voice through them. |
| 410 | Ecce synodum solum ex sacerdotio constitui et laicos vocem in ipsa, maxime in ecclesiasticis rebus dum tractantur, non habere. | If kings and princes have certain things to communicate to the council, they can do so through whomever is commonly and publicly deputed in the place of orators, for no hearing is denied to anyone. |
| 410 | Quare si vocem non habent de iure, tunc ad audiendum tantum venientes iudicio imperiali pro conservanda libertate synodi quoad cuncta synodum respicientia merito subsunt, sine cuius iussione et licentia interesse non deberent. | But to deliberate and define ecclesiastical matters is the duty of priests. |
| 410 | Quare principes mundi non laicos sed episcopos, ut et vocem suam per eos aperire valerent, mittere deberent. | If this were preserved as it was rightly introduced from antiquity, no question about seats or disturbance on account of them would arise in councils. |
| 410 | Et tunc cessaret omnis quaestio, quia quisque iuxta canonicas sanctiones, qui vocem habere vult, in ordine suo iuxta tempus promotionis debet consedere. | But because in the Council of Constance, princes were called, and also in this our Council of Basel, they are wisely present for the sake of having the concord of all, for the vigor of synodal precept comes from concord. |
| 410 | Si vero reges et principes habent synodo certa insinuare, hoc possunt per quoscumque in loco oratorum ad hoc communiter et publice deputato, quia nulla audientia cuiquam denegatur. | And it is necessary, for the preservation of our faith, which has been brought to a narrow place—especially since the emperor's power today does not bind and restrain all as it once did—that matters be treated concordantly also through the advocacy of other princes and kings who are in Christendom, so that all may see the synodal definitions as just, holy, and irreprehensible, that peace may be preserved in the church and schism avoided. |
| 410 | Deliberare vero et res ecclesiasticas diffinire sacerdotum est. | To deliberate and define ecclesiastical matters belongs to the priests. |
| 411 | Hoc si ita, sicut recte ab antiquo introductum est, servaretur, nulla de sedibus quaestio aut eapropter turbatio in synodis exoriretur. | If this were kept as it was rightly introduced from antiquity, no question about seats or disturbance would arise in synods. |
| 411 | Verum quia in Constantiensi concilio principes vocati et etiam in hoc nostro Basiliensi concilio propter habere unam omnium concordantiam consulte satis exsistunt, quia vigor synodicae praeceptionis ex concordantia est. | But because in the Council of Constance, princes were called, and also in this our Council of Basel, to have one harmony of all, they are consulted sufficiently, because the vigor of synodal precept is from harmony. |
| 411 | Et oportet pro conservatione fidei nostrae, quae ad arctum locum redacta est, – maxime cum imperatoris potestas hodie non omnes sicut quondam stringat et compescat – res concorditer per principum etiam aliorum et regum, qui in Christianitate sunt, advocationem, ut omnes synodicas diffinitiones iustas et sanctas et irreprehensibiles videant, tractari, ut pax in ecclesia servetur et schisma vitetur. | And it is necessary for the preservation of our faith, which has been reduced to a narrow place—especially since the power of the emperor today does not bind and restrain all as it once did—that matters be treated harmoniously also by the advocacy of other princes and kings who are in Christendom, so that all synodal definitions may be seen as just, holy, and irreprehensible, so that peace may be kept in the church and schism avoided. |
| 412 | Unde tunc oportet etiam uti magna et sapienti cautela in hiis sedibus vel locationibus, ne ex turbatione, quae ex ambitiosis honoribus praetextu defensionis dignitatis exoriri solent, confusio maior fiat. | Therefore, at that time it is also necessary to exercise great and prudent caution in these positions or placements, lest greater confusion arise from the disturbances that commonly stem from the pretext of defending honor tied to ambitious titles of dignity. |
| 412 | Et posset faciliter succurri per distinctionem locationum ponendo bancum pro imperatore et sibi proxime unitis, pro Francorum rege et sibi coniunctis et similiter pro Hispaniae regibus et aliis, ut absque mixtura diversorum regnorum scampnis secundum ordinem regum positis unusquisque princeps in banco regni sui locaretur. | One could easily assist through the distinction of placements by placing a bench for the emperor, with those closely aligned with him nearby, for the Frankish king and those associated with him, similarly for the kings of Hispania and others, so that without mixing the spoils of various kingdoms, each prince would be seated on the bench of their own kingdom according to the order of kings placed thereon. |
| 412 | Et quod talis quidem ordo in pace danda servaretur, ut secundum ordinem regnorum primum locum in ipsius regni banca habenti pax ceteris per osculum communicanda daretur. | And to ensure that such an order is maintained in giving peace, it must be observed that according to the order of kingdoms, the first place on their respective bench be given to the ruler of that kingdom, with peace then communicated through a kiss to the others. |
| 412 | In processionibus vero reges suo ordine imperatorem lateraliter associarent, aliis omnibus a retro suo ordine pergentibus, regni cuiuslibet nobilibus et ambassiatoribus se ad suum regem linealiter, ad instar ut in banco sederent, colligantibus absque cuiusquam alterius interruptione. | In processions, however, the emperor would join the general in a lateral position according to his order, with all others following behind in their respective ranks, nobles and ambassadors of any kingdom approaching their king in a linear fashion, as if seated on the bench, gathering uninterruptedly. |
| 412 | Si vero duo de eiusdem regni dignitate aut prioritate contendentes forent, talis ordo servetur, ut quisque aeque propinque imperatori admittatur, senior a dextris, iunior a sinistris, absque cuiusque praeiudicio. | Should two individuals from the same kingdom dispute precedence or dignity, this order would be maintained such that each is admitted equally near the emperor, the senior positioned to the right, the junior to the left, without prejudice to either. |
| 413 | Et ita fieret de scampnis utriusque contendentium, scilicet quod senioris bancus a dextris locetur, iunioris a sinistris. | Thus, the spoils of contention between the disputants would be arranged, namely that the senior’s bench would be positioned to the right, the junior’s to the left. |
| 413 | Et in processione quilibet oboedientiarius a tergo secundum suum ordinem per lineam rectam se suo domino colligabit. | And in any procession, the attendant would gather in line behind according to his order, facing his lord. |
| 413 | Haec ordinatio forte, salva meliori, posset scandalis, quae exoriri solent, faciliter obviare, et habet aequitatem planam et pacificam et in iure fundatam, secundum quod superius habetur, quomodo quisque cuiuscumque gradus, alterius personam ut procurator seu legatus indutus in eo loco sedere debet ubi principalis. | This arrangement, barring any minor scandal, could easily deflect the scandals that often arise, embodying a clear, peaceful, and legally founded equity, as previously stated, whereby anyone occupying any rank should sit where the principal ought to sit, even if acting as a procurator or legate, without disrupting the established order. |
| 414 | Haec quidem ordinatio fingit bancum regno aliquo deputatum tamquam sedem regis esse, quem suos ambassiatores, si assunt, seu principes proximiores absque etiam speciali ad hoc regis commissione fingit pro bono pacis repraesentare. | This arrangement indeed metaphorically designates the bench of any kingdom as the seat of the king, with his ambassadors, if present, or proximate leaders representing peace without special royal commission. |
| 414 | Et dum hic ordo in banco quolibet, qui et in ipso regno, praecedentibus commissariis regis et subsequentibus suo ordine principibus servatur, quis dubitat optime pacem quoad hoc posse conservari? | Hence, in maintaining this order on any bench, with previous royal commissioners and subsequent leaders in their ranks within any realm, who would doubt that peace could be best preserved in this manner? |
| 415 | Capitulum XVIII. | Chapter XVIII. |
| 415 | Post haec de hiis, quae sedente synodo imperialis maiestas facere habeat, videndum. | After this, concerning those matters which the imperial synod should undertake, it behooves us to consider. |
| 415 | Reperio autem imperatores aliquando dedisse primatum in synodo, ut in quadam epistula Theodosii et Valentiniani ad Dioscorum in secunda Ephesina dampnata synodo, quae incipit Ante hoc quidem, ubi dicitur: «Necessarium duximus hiis sacris nostris litteris ad tuam uti reverentiam, per quas manifestum facimus tuae beatitudini et universae synodo, quod nos regulas sanctorum patrum sequentes non solum propter Theodericum, sed et alios omnes, qui ad congregatam sanctam synodum pertinent, auctoritatem et primatum tuae praebemus beatitudini. | I find that emperors at times granted precedence in synods, as evidenced in a letter from Theodosius and Valentinian to Dioscorus concerning the Ephesian synod, which states: "We deemed it necessary by our sacred letters to show reverence to your blessedness and to the whole synod, that we grant to your beatitude the authority and precedence over all, not only Theodoric but also all others pertinent to the convened sacred synod." |
| 415 | » Haec ibi. | Here ends the reference. |
| 415 | Sed hoc non legi alibi, quam in illo conciliabulo factum. | However, this was not established elsewhere except in that particular conclave. |
| 415 | Unde, ut in eadem epistula, propter timorem Nestorianorum hoc fuit factum. | According to that letter, it was done out of fear of the Nestorians. |
| 415 | Etiam tunc nondum venerunt nuntii apostolicae Romanae sedis forte. | Moreover, at that time, messengers from the Apostolic See of Rome had not yet arrived perhaps. |
| 415 | Quare ipse Dioscorus Alexandrinus merito primatum habuit. | Therefore, Dioscorus of Alexandria rightly held precedence. |
| 415 | Igitur de hoc non est multum curandum. | Thus, there is little cause for concern regarding this matter. |
| 416 | Sed ipse imperator primo habet curare, ut detur per suos iudices et senatores maxima diligentia, ut canonico more sancto et iusto servato ordine, non ex abrupto vel praecipitanter aut passionate per timorem vel impressionem, seriatim absque materiarum inculcatione tractanda expediantur, ut nihil de institutis per sacros canones ad inquirendum veritatem tam in iudicialibus diffinitionibus quam etiam disputatoriis obmittatur, tamquam neutrales iudices, ut etiam clara et manifesta clarissima fiant, ut recte invariabilis conclusio et eiusdem executio per imperialem maiestatem fieri possit absque omni haesitatione. | Yet, the emperor initially must ensure that through his judges and senators, all matters are diligently examined in accordance with canonical order, not hastily or passionately, nor out of fear or impression, but sequentially without unnecessary exposition of matters, so that nothing discussed may be falsely accused due to its presentation, with witnesses who properly judged endorsing its firmness through their authority. |
| 417 | Et ita lego in omnibus universalibus conciliis imperatores, dum praesentes fuerunt, aut sacri palatii iudices et senatum officium promotorum habuisse ad dirigendum cuncta ad claram veritatis lucem, immo in terminorum observatione et dilatoriis ut iudices cum consilio concilii se habentes, immo etiam aliquando de assensu et approbatione manifesta concilii iudicantes, sicut in quaestione primatiae in Calcedonensi concilio inter patriarcham Constantinopolitanum et Romanum mota iudices sententiarunt iuxta productos canones, interrogantes post iudicium sacram synodum, an consentiret vel aliud videretur. | Thus, in all universal councils where emperors were present, or in the sacred palace, judges and senators acted as promoters guiding all towards clear enlightenment, indeed observing terms and nuances as judges in concert with the council, and sometimes even judging from the manifest assent and approval of the council, as seen in the question of primacy in the Chalcedonian council between the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Rome, where judges rendered their decision according to produced canons, inquiring post-judgment from the sacred synod, whether it consented or seemed otherwise. |
| 417 | Tota vero synodus approbavit, ut legitur in fine gestorum Calcedonensis concilii. | The entire synod approved this, as read at the conclusion of the acts of the Chalcedonian council. |
| 418 | Firmitas autem iudicii et omnium, quae ita aguntur in concilio per quoscumque, ex consensu tantum synodica dependet iuxta superius praemissa. | The firmness of judgment indeed rests solely on synodal consensus as previously mentioned. |
| 418 | Quare, et si aliquando sententiasse iudices tales leguntur, ex consensu et synodica commissione vigor sententiae dependebat et non ex imperiali commissione, cuius auctoritas synodum universalem non praecellit. | Therefore, even if such judgments by judges are recorded elsewhere, their vigor depended on synodal consent rather than imperial commission, whose authority does not surpass that of the universal synod. |
| 418 | Dirigi vero res per viam canonicam, ne quidquam, quod tractatur, possit inculpari propter suam subscriptionem, quam in fine ut testes, qui recto iudicio interfuerunt, pro firmitate appendunt, propria auctoritate petere possunt. | To direct affairs through canonical means, ensuring nothing discussed can be falsely incriminated due to its submission, witnesses who correctly judged should append their authority for firmness. |
| 419 | Longum foret omnia enarrare quomodo per imperatores et iudices interlocutiones directorie rei investigandae pro apertione veritatis fieri solebant. | It would be lengthy to recount how through emperors and judges, investigative discussions traditionally led to clarity of truth. |
| 419 | Sed una est conclusio, scilicet quoniam fiebat eo modo, quo iudicia canonica fieri habent, puta: vocetur ter accusatus, inducatur in synodum, legatur libellus, respondeat delatus, deliberet melius, probetur negatum, ostendatur per gesta synodica ac dicta probabilium patrum, si est haeresis, quae obicitur, iuret producens notarius librum ita in scrinio proprie invenisse, et per talia et consimilia, quae ad causam deserviunt. | Yet, the conclusion is that judgments followed canonical procedure, for example: after three accusers summon, bring before the synod, present the libel, respond, deliberate further, prove denial through synodal deeds and probable sayings of fathers, if heresy is found, its refutation through the canon’s notary book properly placed in the archive, and through such and similar means pertinent to the cause. |
| 419 | Fuit etiam optima consuetudo, quod canones, in quibus quis fundavit intentionem, in scriptis producebantur, et pars respondebat, an fateretur vel suspicaretur mutatum. | It was also a commendable custom for those who founded intentions in canons to have them recorded in writing, with parts responding, whether confessed, suspected alterations noted. |
| 419 | Et sic clarissima fuere semper synodica iudicia et apertissima. | Thus, synodal judgments were always clear and unequivocal. |
| 419 | Et haec de hac materia. | And thus concludes this matter. |
| 420 | Capitulum XIX. | Chapter XIX. |
| 420 | Quae imperator in concilio regulariter agere solitus fuerit, proximo dixi. | I have previously noted how the emperor regularly conducted himself in councils. |
| 420 | Verum exhortationibus gratiosis saepe usus est in conciliis. | Yet, he often used gracious exhortations in councils. |
| 420 | Unde Christianissimi et piissimi Basilii imperatoris, cuius noster Sigismundus, a deo coronatus invictissimus imperator, in hoc Basiliensi concilio vestigia insequitur, ut proprie dicatur sacrum hoc concilium in Basilea Basilio altero praesidente celebrari, aliqua ex octava synodo inserere curavi. | Thus, following in the footsteps of the most Christian and pious Emperor Basil, crowned by God, our Sigismund, the unconquered emperor, in this Basilian council, I have incorporated some from the eighth synod, so that this sacred council held in Basle under Basil’s presidency might be aptly described. |
| 420 | Ita enim in exordio synodi locutus est Basilius imperator mitissimus: «Cum divina et benignissima providentia nobis gubernacula universalis navis commisisset, omne studium arripuimus et ante publicas curas ecclesiasticas dissolvere, et procellas, quae per multos annos ex invidia odientis bonum satanae expansae sunt, in stabilem tranquillitatem per meliorem quandam provisionem transferre. | Indeed, at the synod’s outset, Basil, the merciful emperor, spoke thus: "By divine and most benign providence, we have been entrusted the helm of the universal vessel; all our efforts we have directed towards dissolving ecclesiastical public affairs and transferring the tempests, which for many years have been spread by the envious malice of the evil one, into a stable tranquility through some better provision. |
| 420 | Siquidem munitus divinitus imperio nostro semper hoc desiderium gerente ac ab aliis patriarchalibus sedibus vicarios adducere propter iam dictam causam iudicante, cooperatus est intentioni gubernati divinitus imperii nostri solus infinitae potentiae rex et princeps pacis et, ut aspicitis, concilium nostrum complevit et in id ipsum convenire atque concurrere fecit. | Armed divinely with our rule, always desiring this governance, he cooperated alone, as vicar from other patriarchal sees for the aforementioned cause, adjudicating, he was the sole king and prince of peace, as you behold, completing our council and convening it himself. |
| 421 | A seniori quidem Roma episcopos duos et diaconum unum de diffinitis septem, prudentia, intellectu ac vita venerabili decoratos. | Indeed, the senior bishops in Rome, two in number and one deacon, appointed from the seven definitions, distinguished by prudence, intellect, and venerable life. |
| 421 | Ab oriente vero prototronis Antiochiae sanctissimum metropolitam Tyri, omni reverentia plenum. | From the east, however, the most holy metropolitan of Tyre, Antioch, full of reverence, truly. |
| 421 | A Hierosolymorum autem sancta dei ecclesia, sancta videlicet Sion, de qua exiit, qui prophetatus est, et nova lex et discretor omnium gentium, domini sermo, sanctissimum Sincellum, virum apostolicum, omni sapientia divina et humana refertum. | From the holy church of Jerusalem, namely, the holy Sion, from which the one who prophesied came out, and the new law and the interpreter of all nations, the Lord's word, the most holy Sincellus, a man of apostolic virtue, full of divine and human wisdom. |
| 422 | Igitur cooperatione et gratia Christi universorum regis et dei cuncta tenentis hiis, quae prava vobis omnibus esse videbantur et aspera, in vias planas imperatoria diligentia et studio nostro translatis, commonemus et hortamur omnes vos, fratres, ut cum multo pudore ac reverentia conveniatis ad sanctam hanc et universalem synodum, tamquam ad communem et universis aptam, atque sine labore medelam nullam vitiosam, motionem vel affectum ferentes, nec ad contentiosam voluntatem respicientes, sed potius vinci bene, quam vincere periculose ac iniuste scientes. | Therefore, through the cooperation and grace of Christ, the universal king and God, holding all things, we, with diligent and studious care, have translated the paths that seemed to be crooked and harsh to you all into smooth and imperial ways, and we exhort and encourage all of you, brothers, to gather with great modesty and reverence to this holy and universal synod, as to a common and universal one, and without labor, to bring no vicious remedy, motion, or affection, nor to consider a contentious will, but rather to be conquered well, than to conquer perilously and unjustly, knowing. |
| 422 | Sic enim unusquisque, qui vitiatum interiorem patitur hominem, sanitatem recipiet et aeternam salutem percipiet. | For thus each one, who suffers an inward vitiated man, will receive health and will perceive eternal salvation. |
| 422 | At vero ad vos ipsos acclamationem imperii nostri proponimus, quippe qui potestatem synodici iudicii divinitus accepistis. | But to you yourselves, we propose the acclamation of our empire, indeed, who have received the power of synodical judgment divinely. |
| 422 | Etenim vos veritatis esse ac divinae iustitiae, secundum quod est possibile, dilectores et imitatores nequaquam quidem ambigimus. | For we by no means doubt that you are lovers and imitators of truth and divine justice, as far as possible. |
| 423 | Sed ut et deo munitum imperium nostrum secundum datam sibi potestatis mensuram in ecclesiasticis negotiis nihil tacuisse patescat eorum, quae debent atque conveniunt, deposcimus et religionem vestram, ut omnis gratiae ac odii nunc maxime superatrix efficiatur, quin potius impassibili beataeque naturae ad personam non accipiendam omni robore, quantum fieri potest, assimiletur, et neque personam potentis per gradum vel per amicitiam accipiat, neque pauperis misereatur in iudicio. | But so that it may be evident that our empire, fortified by God, according to the measure of power given to it, has not been silent in ecclesiastical matters, we ask and demand from your religion, that all grace and hatred be now most effectively effaced, rather than impassibly and blessedly assimilated to the person not to be accepted, with all strength, as much as possible, and that you do not accept the person of the powerful by grade or by friendship, nor pity the poor in judgment. |
| 423 | Sic utique secundum consilium utique ac voluntatem dei atque tranquillissimi imperii nostri pacatissima subsequetur ecclesiastica ordinatio. | Thus, the ecclesiastical order will follow, according to the counsel and will of God and our tranquil empire. |
| 423 | » Haec ibi. | "These are here." |
| 424 | Longum foret aliorum divorum imperatorum dulcifluas exhortationes inserere, quas quisque imperator secundum tractandam materiam adaptare studebat more huius piissimi imperatoris ac aliorum. | It would be long to insert the sweet exhortations of other divine emperors, which each emperor strove to adapt according to the matter to be treated, following the example of this most pious emperor and others. |
| 425 | Capitulum XX. | Chapter XX. |
| 425 | Solebant etiam imperatores ipsis absentibus committere locum tenentibus allocutionem ad concilium et persuasiones pro occurrenti materia. | Emperors were accustomed to entrust the address to the council and persuasions according to the matter, even in their absence. |
| 425 | Sic legitur in septima actione eiusdem octavi concilii Bahanem patricium et praepositum ad concilium dixisse, Photio cum suis episcopis in concilio exsistente: «Sanctus imperator noster vult facere allocutionem ad istos per me indignum servum suum. | Thus, it is read in the seventh action of the same eighth council, Bahanes, the patrician and prepositus to the council, said: "The holy emperor wants to make an address to these through me, his unworthy servant." |
| 425 | » Sanctissimi vicarii senioris Romae dixerunt: «Sicut iubet imperium eius. | "The most holy vicars of the senior of Rome said: 'As his empire commands.'" |
| 425 | » Bahanes dixit ad Photium et episcopos eius: «Hortatorie alloquitur vos imperator. | "Bahanes said to Photius and his bishops: 'The emperor speaks to you in a persuasive manner.'" |
| 425 | Homines, dicite, unde estis? | "Men, say, from where are you?" |
| 425 | De caelo estis, de abysso estis, an de terra, in qua nos degimus? | "From heaven, from the abyss, or from the earth, on which we live?" |
| 425 | Et ostendite mihi hac hora, quia sive haeresis mota est sive schisma emerserit in qualibet parte, et senserit aliquis extra quattuor patriarchia, quid salvatusne est? | "And show me at this hour, because if heresy has been stirred up or schism has emerged in any part, and someone outside the four patriarchates has felt it, what has been saved?" |
| 425 | Et audio <vos>. | "And I hear you." |
| 425 | Hodie quattuor patriarchia, immo vero quinque, quae condempnatione condempnant vos. | "Today, the four patriarchates, indeed, the five, which condemn you by condemnation." |
| 425 | Quid vobis videtur ad haec? | "What seems to you about these?" |
| 425 | Estne, qui adiuvet vos? | "Is there anyone who will help you?" |
| 425 | Dicite. | "Say." |
| 425 | » Episcopi Photii dixerunt: «Canones sanctorum apostolorum et sanctorum patrum. | "The bishops of Photius said: 'The canons of the holy apostles and the holy fathers.'" |
| 425 | » Bahanes iussu imperatoris dixit: «Dicite quid canon vos adiuvet et ubi posuerit dominus canones, in ecclesiis suis an in alio aliquo loco, et ubi ecclesiae sint hodie et ubi praedicetur evangelium. | "Bahanes, by the emperor's order, said: 'Say what canon will help you and where the Lord will place the canons, in their churches or in another place, and where the churches are today and where the gospel is preached.'" |
| 425 | Estne alius locus, quam quem tenent vicarii isti? | "Is there another place than that which the vicars hold?" |
| 425 | Dicite. | "Say." |
| 425 | » Episcopi Photii dixerunt: «Deus custodiat imperatorem nostrum. | "The bishops of Photius said: 'May God protect our emperor.'" |
| 425 | Verbum petivimus impunitatis, ut diceremus negotia nostra cum fiducia, et non accepimus. | "We requested the word of impunity, so that we could speak our business with confidence, and we did not receive it." |
| 425 | Qualiter ergo habemus loqui? | "How, then, do we have to speak?" |
| 425 | » Bahanes dixit: «Sanctus imperator noster admonentis affectu ad vos dicit: Utique deus ideo audivit deprecationem meam et adduxit hos sanctos viros de finibus mundi, ne quid secundum faciem fiat, sed ex aequo ponatur iudicio in iustissimum. | "Bahanes said: 'The holy emperor, admonishing with affection, says to you: 'Indeed, God heard my supplication and brought these holy men from the ends of the world, so that nothing is done according to appearance, but justice is established according to equity.'" |
| 425 | Dicitis, ut accipiatis verbum securitatis, et tunc, quis a me tristatus vel laesus fuerit, volo, ut dicatis. | "You say, so that you may accept the word of security, and then, whoever has been distressed or injured by me, I want you to say." |
| 425 | Ideo sunt hic vicarii omnium sedium, ut, quidquid habetis in iustificationem vestram, loquamini. | "Therefore, these vicars of all the sees are here, so that you may speak what you have in your justification." |
| 425 | » Episcopi Photii dixerunt: «Scimus imperium sanctum eius, quia neminem vult contristari. | "The bishops of Photius said: 'We know the holy emperor's empire, because he wants to harm no one.'" |
| 425 | Quid volumus dicere? | "What do we want to say?" |
| 425 | Si dixerimus iustitias nostras, non fient. | "If we say our justifications, they will not be done." |
| 426 | Bahanes dixit: «Propter imperatorem nostrum sanctum, nihil prohibemini. | "Bahanes said: 'Because of our holy emperor, you are not prohibited from speaking.' |
| 426 | Iubet etenim et vult et acquiescit, ut loquamini. | "He commands, wants, and agrees that you may speak." |
| 426 | Sed videntes iudices convicia vestra, nec audire vos volunt. | "But seeing the judges, your insults, and not willing to hear you." |
| 426 | » Episcopi Photii dixerunt: «Et nos iudices ipsos non recipimus. | "The bishops of Photius said: 'And we do not receive the judges themselves.'" |
| 426 | » Bahanes dixit: «Et reicit regula patriarchia et irrationabiliter iudicant? | "Bahanes said: 'And do they reject the rule of the patriarchate and judge irrationally?'" |
| 426 | » Amphilochus, Photii episcopus, dixit: «Irrationabilissime. | "Amphilochus, bishop of Photius, said: 'Most irrationally.'" |
| 426 | » Bahanes dixit: «Et ex transcensu regulae et patriarcharum suorum iudicant? | "Bahanes said: 'And do they judge from beyond the rule and the patriarchs of their own?'" |
| 426 | » Photii episcopi dixerunt: «Extra. | "The bishops of Photius said: 'Yes.'" |
| 426 | » Bahanes dixit: «Ite ad patriarchia et certificamini. | "Bahanes said: 'Go to the patriarchates and be certified.'" |
| 426 | » Basilius piissimus imperator et amicus Christi dixit: «Quotquot creditis per omnia, quod a patriarchiis venerint homines isti cum commendaticiis litteris, et non habetis aliquam ambiguitatem, suscipite illos et quae iudicantur ab ipsis. | "Basilius, the most pious emperor and friend of Christ, said: 'As many as you believe, through all things, that these men came from the patriarchs with commendatory letters, and you have no doubt, receive them and what is judged by them.'" |
| 426 | Quotquot autem dubitatis ad hoc, et non habetis eos iustos neque secundum verbum patriarcharum suorum agentes, ite ad eos et discite ab illis et adducite etiam ad nos, immo vero, quod plus certum exsistit, et disponemus ita. | "As many as, however, doubt this, and do not have them as just, nor acting according to the word of their patriarchs, go to them and learn from them, and bring them to us, indeed, what is more certain, and we will arrange it thus." |
| 426 | » Episcopi Photii dixerunt: «Nos iudicium non vidimus, et quomodo habemus sequi, quod nos non vidimus? | "The bishops of Photius said: 'We have not seen the judgment, and how do we have to follow what we have not seen?'" |
| 426 | » Bahanes iussus ab imperatore dixit: «Sanctus imperator dicit: Ne dicatis, fratres, quod velim vos mittere illuc, ut pereat quis vestrum. | "Bahanes, ordered by the emperor, said: 'The holy emperor says: 'Do not say, brothers, that I want you to send one of you there, so that he may perish.'" |
| 426 | Testis est deus: quem misero illo in conspectu totius senatus et sanctae synodi, dico, iterum reducam eum huc. | "God is witness: I, in the presence of the entire senate and holy synod, say again, I will bring him back here." |
| 427 | Multa talia, quae notanda forent, in actis leguntur. | Many such things, which were worthy of note, are read in the acts. |
| 427 | Ista ex causa, quoniam singularia quaedam perpetuo notanda continent, inserui, scilicet quomodo imperator omnino procurare debet, ut luce clarius absque omni dubitabili actu gesta conciliorum peragantur. | I inserted this, because certain singular things are contained, which are to be noted perpetually, namely, how the emperor should entirely take care, so that the councils are carried out more clearly without any doubtful act. |
| 428 | Adhuc est aliud quoddam singulare in ipsis gestis. | There is another singular thing in their deeds. |
| 428 | Legitur, dum se episcopi Photii multis argumentis et gestis defendere vellent, imperator dixit quod allegati per illos sanati postea per ecclesiam fuerunt: «Vos autem usque ad praesens in peccato vestro estis et in sepulcro nequitiae vestrae iace tis mortui. | It is read, while the bishops of Photius wanted to defend themselves with many arguments and deeds, the emperor said that the ones alleged by them had been healed later by the church: 'You, however, are still in your sin and lie in the tomb of your wickedness, dead men.' |
| 428 | Unde omnes summi sacerdotes patriarchae vos condempnant concorditer. | 'From where are you all, the highest priests, patriarchs, who condemn you unanimously.' |
| 428 | A deo vero munitum imperium nostrum placidum et benignum est et vestri curam gerit et consulit, ut percipiatis misericordias, quas deliberaverit sancta et universalis synodus. | 'But our empire, truly fortified by God, is peaceful and benevolent, and takes care of your concerns and consults, so that you may receive the mercies which the holy and universal synod has deliberated.' |
| 428 | Nam omnes novimus, quia laici estis, et non adduximus vos latrare et sine ordine facere. | 'For we all know that you are laymen, and we did not bring you to bark and do things without order.' |
| 428 | Verba omnia enim vestra mendacia sunt et seductio. | 'All your words, indeed, are lies and deception.'" |
| 428 | » Photii episcopi dixerunt: «Hoc nec diabolus est ausus dicere, ac si dicerent dicere nos esse laicos. | "The bishops of Photius said: 'This is not even what the devil dared to say, as if they said that we are laymen.'" |
| 429 | Imperator autem ideo eos laicos dicit, quia a Photio, qui non fuit episcopus, ordinati fuerunt et ipsi volebant defendere Photium et se ipsos. | The emperor says them to be laymen because they were ordained by Photius, who was not a bishop, and they wanted to defend Photius and themselves. |
| 429 | Et quia quidam Eulampius de Photianis episcopis ad verba venit cum imperatore, vicarii apostolicae sedis dixerunt Eulampium ab apostolica sede dampnatum et excommunicatum, et ideo verba secum imperator facere non deberet. | And because some Eulampius came to the emperor with the words of the Photian bishops, the vicars of the apostolic see said that Eulampius was damned and excommunicated by the apostolic see, and therefore he should not speak with the emperor. |
| 430 | Tunc dixit Basilius: «Ego crebro et multo rogavi, ne perirent, et ideo vocavi eos huc. | Then Basilius said: 'I often and much begged that they not perish, and therefore I called them here.' |
| 430 | Si nolunt concurrere ad ecclesiam, quidquid iudicaverint patriarchae, etiam si noluerint, confirmabunt. | 'If they do not want to concur with the church, whatever the patriarchs have judged, they will also confirm, even if they do not want to.' |
| 430 | Nemo enim potest datam eis potestatem a Christo deo et salvatore nostro reprobare. | 'For no one can reject the power given to them by Christ, our God and Savior.'" |
| 430 | » Ecce quanta pietas et cura in imperatore esse debet et demum fides et constantia in diffinitis synodicis. | "Behold, how much piety and care should be in the emperor, and finally, faith and constancy in synodical definitions." |
| 431 | Capitulum XXI. | Chapter XXI. |
| 431 | Debet etiam ipse imperator avisamenta pro tractandis negotiis concilio aperire, et si qua sibi quaedam ad statuendum videntur, quae ad synodum spectant, aperire et instare, ut statuantur. | The emperor himself ought also to open the council with suggestions for discussing matters, and if certain things seem to him to require determination, which pertain to the synod, to bring them forward and press for their enactment. |
| 431 | Unde Martianus imperator in concilio Calcedonensi ad synodum dixit: «Sunt quaedam certa capitula, quae honoris respectu vestrae reservamus sanctitati, congruum rati regulariter a vobis ista synodali disponi consilio potius, quam nostris legibus statui. | Whence the Emperor Martian said in the Council of Chalcedon to the synod: "There are certain definite chapters which, out of respect for your holiness, we reserve, deeming it fitting that these should be regularly arranged by your synodal council rather than established by our laws." |
| 431 | » Et iubente sacratissimo et piissimo principe Beronicianus vir devotissimus, secretarius divini consistorii, capitula ita relegit. | And at the command of the most sacred and pious prince, Beronicianus, a most devoted man, secretary of the divine consistory, read the chapters as follows. |
| 431 | Et fuit primum capitulum monachos, qui per singulas civitates sunt atque provincias, subici episcopo et quietem amplecti et attendere solo ieiunio et orationi. | And the first chapter was that monks, who are throughout the individual cities and provinces, should be subject to the bishop and embrace quietude, and attend solely to fasting and prayer. |
| 432 | Et hoc idem legitur per Henricum et Carolum reges simul cum certis episcopis Confluentiae dioecesis Treverensis in concilio exsistentes de monachis statutum. | And the same is read concerning Henry and Charles, kings, together with certain bishops of the diocese of Trier present at the council, concerning the statutes regarding monks. |
| 433 | Secundum capitulum fuit, quod clerici non deberent se curis mundanarum rerum subicere, possessiones conducere et procuratores fieri. | The second chapter was that clerics ought not to subject themselves to the cares of worldly affairs, to lease possessions, or to become procurators. |
| 433 | Tertium capitulum, quod clerici in uno titulo permanere debent et ibi ministrare, ubi ab initio deputati sunt. | The third chapter, that clerics ought to remain in one title and minister there where they were initially appointed. |
| 433 | Ista capitula fuerunt laudata a sancta synodo, recepta et decreta, licet, proh dolor, hodie non serventur. | These chapters were praised by the holy synod, received and decreed, although, alas, they are not observed today. |
| 434 | Sic imperatores Theodosius et Valentinianus ad Ephesinum concilium de Iba episcopo scripsisse leguntur: «Imperatores caesares Theodosius et Valentinianus victores ac triumphatores semper colendi augusti sanctae synodo Ephesinae. | Thus the emperors Theodosius and Valentinian are read to have written to the Ephesian council concerning Bishop Iba: "The emperors Caesars Theodosius and Valentinian, victors and triumphators, always to be revered, to the holy synod of Ephesus." |
| 434 | Plurimae relationes ab Edessenorum civitate Osdroenae provinciae cum monumentis, quae ibi sunt habita, huc directae sunt, in quibus infertur depositio plurimorum reverendissimorum clericorum et religiosissimorum archimandritum et eorum, qui in dignitatibus constituti sunt. | Very many reports from the city of Edessa in the province of Osroene, with the documents which were held there, have been directed here, in which is alleged the deposition of very many most reverend clerics and most religious archimandrites and those who were constituted in dignities. |
| 434 | Et fere universe eiusdem civitatis populi testimonium perhibent contra Ibam, Edessenae urbis episcopum, de multa impietate atque blasphemia. | And almost all the people of the same city bear witness against Iba, bishop of the city of Edessa, concerning much impiety and blasphemy. |
| 434 | Quia igitur tale scelus per vestram corrigi consequens est sanctitatem, tantorum enim testimonium discredere sanctum non est, dignetur igitur sanctitas vestra testimonia et gesta legere, ipsum amovere et alterum religiosum ibidem constituere. | Since therefore such a crime ought to be corrected by your holiness, for it is not holy to disbelieve such great testimony, may your holiness therefore deign to read the testimonies and acts, to remove him and to constitute another religious man in his place. |
| 434 | Si enim maiorum praepositi urbium orthodoxi fuerint, necessario et reliqui eorum magisteria sequentur. | For if the chief magistrates of the cities are orthodox, necessarily the rest will also follow their teaching. |
| 434 | » Talia et consimilia secundum temporis opportunitatem soliti fuere avisamenta dare sacri imperatores, quod cedat nostro gloriosissimo Sigismundo et suis successoribus in exemplum. | Such and similar suggestions the sacred emperors were accustomed to give according to the opportunity of the time, which may serve as an example to our most glorious Sigismund and his successors. |
| 435 | Capitulum XXII. | Chapter XXII. |
| 435 | Ultimo quoad hanc materiam scire debet imperialis celsitudo, quod statuta et diffinita per sacra concilia omni modo curare debet, ut serventur, etiam per leges poenas non servantibus infligendas. | Finally, as regards this matter, imperial majesty ought to know that the statutes and definitions made by sacred councils ought by all means to be observed, even by means of laws inflicting penalties on those who do not observe them. |
| 435 | Unde cum inquisitione decenti debet in sacro concilio inquirere, an communi consilio et consensu diffinita sint ea, quae publicantur suae maiestati. | Whence with fitting inquiry it ought to be investigated in the sacred council whether those things which are published to his majesty were defined by common counsel and consent. |
| 435 | Piissimus enim Martianus lecta sibi fide in Calcedona, quae in symbolum redacta fuit, interrogavit, si omnium consensu religiosorum episcoporum firmarentur lecta, et habito responso per synodum, quod sic, quae magnas etiam laudes dixit imperatori, ipse imperator legem apposuit sic dicendo: «Pia et catholica fides pro patrum traditionibus a sancta est synodo demonstrata. | For the most pious Martian, having had the faith read to him at Chalcedon, which was reduced to a symbol, inquired whether the things read were confirmed by the unanimous consent of the religious bishops, and having received a response from the synod that it was so, he spoke great praise to the emperor, and the emperor himself added a law, saying thus: "The pious and catholic faith has been demonstrated by the holy synod according to the traditions of the fathers." |
| 435 | Iustum pariter atque utile nostra probavit esse tranquillitas omnem in posterum contentionis materiam de sincera religione prorsus auferri. | Our tranquility has proved to be both just and useful in removing completely for the future all matter of contention concerning sincere religion. |
| 435 | Si quis igitur aut privatus aut militaris adhaerens stipendiis sive clero sociatus publicam de fide contentionem faciat seu vulgi perturbationem concitet, sciat, quod, qui privati conditione notatus est, a sacratissima urbe pelletur, militaris vero de sua militia et clericus de suo gradu periclitabuntur, etiam aliis subdendi suppliciis. | If therefore anyone, whether private citizen or soldier attached to the payrolls or associated with the clergy, shall make public contention concerning the faith or incite disturbance among the populace, let him know that he who is marked by private status shall be expelled from the most sacred city, while the soldier shall be in danger of his military service and the cleric of his rank, being also subject to other punishments. |
| 435 | » Sancta synodus acclamavit: «Multos annos principi Christiano. | The holy synod acclaimed: "Many years to the Christian prince!" |
| 435 | Principem te per multos annos optamus. | "We pray for you, prince, for many years!" |
| 436 | Similia adducere possem de multis gestis conciliorum. | I could adduce similar things from many acts of councils. |
| 436 | Sed piissimi Basilii dictum, quoniam nota dignum, sententiosum et memoria dignissimum, non potui non inserere. | But the saying of the most pious Basil, since it is worthy of note, pithy, and most worthy of memory, I could not but insert. |
| 436 | Ita enim legitur in conclusione concilii octavi: «Basilius piissimus et Christo amabilis imperator ad synodum dixit: | For thus it is read in the conclusion of the eighth council: "Basil, most pious and Christ-loving emperor, said to the synod:" |
| 437 | Capitulum XXIII. | Chapter XXIII. |
| 437 | Multam quidem vexationem et laborem vestra divinitus collecta pertulit sanctitas singulis vobis hincinde confluentibus ad felicissimam urbem nostram causa ecclesiasticae ordinationis et constitutionis, pro qua etiam diuturnam in ea moram sustinuistis, et propter quam multi et senectutem contempsistis et corporalem infirmitatem parvipendistis et fortes facti eorum, quae requiei non congruunt, tolerastis et diuturnam separationem spiritualium filiorum vestrorum magnanimiter pertulistis. | Your divinely assembled holiness has indeed endured much vexation and labor, each of you flowing together from here and there to our most blessed city for the sake of ecclesiastical ordering and constitution, for which you have also endured a prolonged stay there, and for which many have despised old age and disregarded bodily infirmity, and have become strong, enduring things which are not suited to rest, and have magnanimously endured the prolonged separation from your spiritual children. |
| 437 | Sed ecce dolorum et laborum vestrorum videtis, quam sit finis suavis et ecclesiae dei proficuus. | But behold, you see the end of your sorrows and labors, how sweet it is and how profitable for the church of God. |
| 437 | Nam communis concursus et in spiritu sancto magnae huius et universalis synodi consensus omne scandalum et offendiculum de medio removit ecclesiae huiusque multi temporis procellas compescuit et ad limpidam tranquillitatem traduxit. | For the common concourse and the agreement in the Holy Spirit of this great and universal synod has removed every scandal and stumbling block from the midst of the church, and has restrained the storms of this long time and led it to clear tranquility. |
| 438 | Gratias ergo agimus domino, patres mirabiles, de omnibus bonis, quae nobis a deo concessa sunt, et admittimus zelum vestrum, qui secundum deum est, et optamus a munificentia magni dei et rege universitatis opulentam tribui vobis mercedem dolores vestros et labores recompensantem, pro quibus et tranquillitas nostra festinabit reficere ac animare vos et omne desiderium vestrum implere. | Therefore we give thanks to the Lord, wonderful fathers, for all the good things which have been granted to us by God, and we acknowledge your zeal, which is according to God, and we pray that from the munificence of the great God and King of the universe a rich reward may be granted to you, recompensing your sorrows and labors, for which our tranquility will hasten to refresh and encourage you and to fulfill every desire of yours. |
| 438 | In omnium autem audientium expressa fateri et hoc iustum putavimus pro communi omnium nostrum munimine et sanctae dei ecclesiae perseveranti tranquillitate propter eos, qui communi invident felicitati et vulnerantur quidam sagitta serpentis super ecclesiastica ordinatione. | And we have thought it just to confess this openly in the hearing of all, for the common defense of us all and the persevering tranquility of the holy church of God, on account of those who envy the common happiness and are wounded by some arrow of the serpent concerning ecclesiastical ordering. |
| 438 | Congratulantur autem huius commotioni et aestui atque delitias aestimant, si viderint eam in tempestate fluctuantem. | But they congratulate themselves on this commotion and turmoil and esteem it a delight if they see it fluctuating in a storm. |
| 439 | Talibus ergo expresse hodie dicimus: Quisquis habet aliquid adversus hanc sanctam et universalem synodum dicendum vel contra huius canones aut terminum, stet in medio et, quae sibi videntur, edicat, sive episcopus sit sive quisquam de ecclesiastico clero sive laicus aut ex iis, qui civilibus officiis mancipantur, exsistat, quamquam non sit datum istis secundum canonem dicendi quidquam penitus de ecclesiasticis causis – opus enim hoc pontificum et sacerdotum est – sed ex abundanti omne os iniquum obstruere volentes licentiam praestamus omnibus, ut qui in mente habet quid ambiguum de hiis, quae decreta sunt ab hac sancta synodo, hoc in medium exhibeat et suscipiat satisfactionis salubre remedium. | Therefore to such we say expressly today: Whoever has anything to say against this holy and universal synod or against its canons or decrees, let him stand forth and declare what seems to him, whether he be a bishop or anyone of the ecclesiastical clergy or a layman or one of those who are engaged in civil offices, let him come forward, although it is not granted to these according to canon to say anything at all about ecclesiastical causes—for this is the work of pontiffs and priests—but wishing to stop every wicked mouth abundantly, we grant license to all, so that whoever has in mind anything ambiguous about those things which have been decreed by this holy synod, may bring this forward and receive the salutary remedy of satisfaction. |
| 440 | Non modicum certamen certavimus neque labori cuilibet cessimus, ut et ipsi nobiscum nostis, ad congregandum eos, qui a Roma et ab orientis patriarchalibus sedibus convenerunt, quos conducere multi quidem et ante nos conati sunt, sed nullo modo valuerunt. | We have striven no little contest nor yielded to any labor, as you yourselves know with us, to assemble those who have come together from Rome and from the patriarchal sees of the East, whom many indeed before us have attempted to bring together, but in no way have they been able. |
| 440 | Nonque modicam vexationem et contritionem etiam deo amantissimi sum mi sacerdotes sustinuerunt a longe concurrentes ad sanctae huius synodi tractatum. | And not a little vexation and tribulation have even my most God-loving priests endured, coming together from afar to the discussion of this holy synod. |
| 440 | Qui ergo habet quid dicendum, dicat, dum haec celebratur. | Therefore whoever has anything to say, let him say it while this is being celebrated. |
| 440 | Nam soluta sancta et universali synodo, qui apparuerit ecclesiae dei contradicens aut non communicans ei, sive episcopus sit sive absolute sacerdos sive dignitate aliqua praeditus vel aliter conversatus, veniam ab imperio nostro minime consequetur, sed iuste condempnabitur et a civitate nostra pelletur ut corruptor et pestilens et membrum putridum et inutile et commune corpus ecclesiae violans. | For when the holy and universal synod is dissolved, whoever shall appear to contradict the church of God or not to communicate with it, whether he be a bishop or absolutely a priest or endowed with some dignity or otherwise behaving, shall by no means obtain pardon from our empire, but shall be justly condemned and expelled from our city as a corrupter and pestilent and a putrid and useless member and one violating the common body of the church. |
| 441 | Vos autem, amatores virtutum, a deo amicissimi summi sacerdotes, qui episcopali decoramini dono, singuli commonere proprium &laddgregem&radd et ad salutem ducere ne pigritemini demonstrantes, quantum malum sit eos ecclesia dei manente in tranquillitate ab illa dissilire et contra eos, qui praesunt animabus suis, insanire et a divinis mysteriis propter irrationabiles et viles occasiones sese coercere. | But you, lovers of virtues, closest friends of God, most sacred priests, who are adorned with the gift of episcopal dignity, do not be slow to unite your particular flock and lead them to salvation, showing how evil it is for them to depart from the Church of God in tranquility and to rage against those who preside over their souls, and to deprive themselves of the divine mysteries for irrational and vile reasons. |
| 441 | Et quidem subiectum vobis gregem per unumquemque dominicum diem verbis doctrinae confirmantes ad divinarum voluntatum dirigite perfectionem. | And indeed, direct the flock subject to you through each Lord's day, confirming them with words of doctrine, to the perfection of divine will. |
| 441 | Eos vero, qui per errores haereseos cuiusquam detinentur, tamquam pastores boni convertite. | But convert those who are held by the errors of any heresy, as good shepherds. |
| 441 | Noverit enim virtutibus plena perfectio vestra, quia, si notum fuerit vobis, quod haeresis quaecumque in provincia cuiusquam vestrum latitans non per assiduam doctrinam vestram radicitus evellatur et omnes ad orthodoxam fidem manuducantur, canonice huiusmodi episcopus a proprio patriarcha condempnabitur. | For your perfection is full of virtues, because, if you know, that any heresy lurking in your province will not be rooted out by your constant doctrine, and all will be led to the orthodox faith, the bishop of this kind will be condemned by his own patriarch. |
| 441 | Et sacris quidem doctrinis atque abominationibus taliter sacratissimus grex vester per pascua salutaria pascatur. | And your most sacred flock is indeed nourished by such sacred teachings and abominations through salutary pastures. |
| 442 | Ipsi autem in alterutrum pacifici estote et ecclesiae vinculum indisruptum conservate, in quo laborastis et concordastis quodque verbo et manu in praesenti sancta et universali synodo confirmastis, ne per contentionem et pertinaciam mutuam disruptionem rursus communis ecclesiae corporis faciatis et non habeatis veniam in die iustissimae retributionis. | But be at peace with one another and preserve the unbroken bond of the Church, in which you have labored and concurred, and which you have confirmed with word and hand in this present holy and universal synod, lest you cause the disruption of the common body of the Church again through contention and mutual obstinacy, and do not have mercy on the day of the most just retribution. |
| 442 | Sed amicitia vestra et consensus sit ad ordinationem totius orbis districtissima norma. | But let your friendship and consensus be the most strict norm for the ordering of the entire world. |
| 442 | In vos contemplantur subditi quemadmodum pictores ad principalia, et ad vitam vestram et mores seu conversationem moderari probantur. | You are looked up to by your subjects as painters are to their principal works, and it is proved that you are to regulate your life and morals. |
| 443 | Sed et qui in clero deputati estis ecclesiae dei, eandem conservate constitutionem et alternam concordiam in nullo declinantes vel praeter quae sancita sunt spiritu sancto ab hac magna et universali synodo praedicantes. | But also, those who are appointed to the clergy of the Church of God, preserve the same constitution and mutual concord, deviating in no way or going beyond what has been sanctified by the Holy Spirit in this great and universal synod. |
| 443 | Nam et ipsi in omnibus convenistis et sole clarius veritatem resplendere vidistis, in quam et consensistis et concordantes apparuistis. | For you all have agreed and seen the truth shine more clearly, in which you have concurred and appeared in concord. |
| 444 | De vobis autem laicis, tam qui in dignitatibus tam qui absolute conversamini, quid amplius dicam? | But as for you laymen, whether you hold dignities or live absolutely, what more can I say? |
| 444 | Non habeo, quam quia nullo modo vobis licet de ecclesiasticis causis sermonem movere neque penitus resistere integritati ecclesiae et universali synodo adversari. | I have nothing to say to you, except that it is not permitted to you in any way to speak about ecclesiastical matters, nor to resist the integrity of the Church and the universal synod. |
| 445 | Haec enim investigare et quaerere patriarcharum, pontificum et sacerdotum est, qui regiminis officium sortiti sunt, qui sanctificandi, qui solvendi et ligandi potestatem habent, qui ecclesiasticas et caelestes adepti sunt claves, non nostrum, qui pasci debemus, qui sanctificari, qui ligari vel a ligamento solvi egemus. | For it is the task of the patriarchs, bishops, and priests to investigate and seek, who have the office of governance, who have the power to sanctify, to loose, and to bind, who have acquired the keys of the Church and of heaven, not ours, who must be fed, sanctified, bound, or loosed. |
| 445 | Quantaecumque enim religionis et sapientiae laicus exsistat, vel etiam si universa virtute interius polleat, donec laicus est, ovis vocari non desinet. | For however much a layman may exist in religion and wisdom, or even if he may be full of all virtue inwardly, until he is a layman, he will not cease to be called a sheep. |
| 445 | Rursusque episcopus, quantacumque sit irreverentia plenus et nudus omni virtute, donec antistes est et veritatis verbum recte praedicaverit, pastoris intentionis et dignitatis dampna non patietur. | And the bishop, however full of irreverence and naked of all virtue he may be, until he is an elder and has preached the word of truth correctly, will not suffer the damage of the intention and dignity of a pastor. |
| 446 | Quae ergo nobis ratio est in ordine ovium constitutis pastores verborum subtilitatem discutiendi et ea, quae super nos sunt, quaerendi et ambiendi? | What reason is there for us, constituted as shepherds of the flock, to discuss the subtlety of words and to seek and ask for those things that are above us? |
| 446 | Oportet nos ergo cum timore et fide sincera hos adire et facies eorum vereri, cum sint ministri domini omnipotentis et huius formam possideant, et nihil amplius quam ea, quae nostri ordinis sunt, requirere. | We must therefore approach these with fear and sincere faith, and reverence their faces, since they are ministers of the almighty Lord and possess this form, and not require anything more than what belongs to our order. |
| 446 | Nunc autem, ut videmus, adeo multos malitia in insaniam accendit, <ut> obliviscentes proprii ordinis et, quod pedes sint, minime cogitantes, legem ponere velint oculis, non ut natura se habet, <sed> sicut ipsi cupiunt, et singuli ad accusandum quidem maiores semper exsistunt promptissimi, ad corrigendum autem, quid eorum in quibus accusantur et criminantur, pigerrimi. | Now, as we see, so many are inflamed with malice that, forgetting their own order and not at all thinking that they are sheep, they wish to lay down the law with their eyes, not as it is, but as they desire, and each one is always the most eager to accuse the elders, but the most reluctant to correct what they accuse and condemn in others. |
| 446 | Et moneo et exhortor omnes, qui tales sunt, ut maledictum et alternum odium avertentes et iudicare iudices desinentes attendant sibi et secundum divinam voluntatem conversari contendant. | And I warn and exhort all who are like this to turn away from the evil word and mutual hatred, and to cease judging others, and to attend to themselves and to strive to live according to the divine will. |
| 446 | Nam non quie scet supernum iudicium, sed contra dissidentes divinus furor stillabit et iustam ultionem opere cunctis ostendet. | For it is not known who will escape the supreme judgment, but the divine wrath will pour out against those who dissent, and will show just retribution to all in their works. |
| 446 | Oramus autem super omnia sanctum deum omnes inter melioratos, [id est primos praesides,] et secundum beneplacentem sibi voluntatem clarescentes non solum a divina ira intemptatos mansuros, sed et aeterna bona consecuturos orationibus et intercessionibus sanctissimae dominae nostrae genitricis et omnium sanctorum et precibus ac obsecrationibus sanctae huius et universalis synodi. | We pray above all to the holy God that all the leading men, that is, the first rulers, and those who are pleasing to Him, may not only remain untouched by divine wrath, but also attain eternal goods through the prayers and intercessions of our most holy mother, the Mother of God, and all the saints, and the prayers and supplications of this holy and universal synod. |
| 446 | Amen. | Amen. |
| 447 | Et post lectionem Basilius, amicus Christi et magnus imperator, dixit: Dicat nunc quicumque voluerit ex sedentibus in hac sancta et universali synodo, in quo istorum haesitet vel ambigat, quae nunc lecta sunt. | And after the reading, Basil, a friend of Christ and a great emperor, said: Let whoever wants to from those sitting in this holy and universal synod say now, in which of these they hesitate or are uncertain, after what has been read. |
| 447 | Sancta synodus exclamavit: Omnibus placent, quae lecta sunt. | The holy synod exclaimed: All that has been read is pleasing to all. |
| 447 | Omnes eisdem ipsis concordamus. | We all agree with the same things. |
| 447 | Omnes libenter subscribimus. | We all subscribe willingly. |
| 448 | Ecce formam piissimi Basilii, quam noster omni clementia refertus alter Basilius et quisque catholicus imperator acceptet, ut sic praecedenti clara praevia cognitione approbationum ore et manu omnium, qui synodo intersunt, subiungat approbatorium et confirmatorium sigillum cum sanctione poenali et coerciva, ut et dictata serventur et venerentur. | Behold the form of the most pious Basil, which our most merciful emperor Basil and each Catholic emperor will accept, so that, with prior clear knowledge of the approbations, with the mouth and hand of all who are present at the synod, he may attach the approbatory and confirmatory seal with penal and coercive sanction, so that what has been decreed may be observed and revered. |
| 448 | Debet etiam ipse, communis omnium pater, cunctos admonere etiam sacerdotes, ut quisque officio suo satisfaciat et altissimo vota persolvat, et maxime ad hoc attendere, ut per proprios veros et non mercenarios pastores grex et Christi membra salubriter pascantur. | He should also himself, the common father of all, admonish and exhort all the priests to satisfy each in their office and to pay their vows to the highest, and above all to attend to this, that the flock and the members of Christ may be fed healthily by their own true and not mercenary pastors. |
| 448 | Et maxime debet omnibus paternam curam adhibere et per pietatis viam oberrantes ad viam iustam reducere omnibus possibilibus modis. | And he should above all have paternal care for all and, by the way of piety, lead those who are wandering to the just way by all possible means. |
| 448 | Homo enim animal est nobile, quod potius vult duci quam trahi, et omne ferox animal placat amica manus. | For man is a noble animal, which is rather willing to be led than dragged, and every fierce animal is soothed by gentle hands. |
| 449 | Unde, ut hanc sollertiam per exemplum dulcissimi Basilii ostendamus, epanagnosticon sermonem, quam in ipsa synodo ad ipsos episcopos cum Photio invasore sedis Constantinopolitanae schisma facientes, qui plenus omni suavitate et doctrina exsistit, subiungamus: Ex actione sexta universalis octavi concilii epanagnosticum in dissensione schismaticorum, ut sequitur. | Wherefore, to show this prudence by the example of the most sweet Basil, let us add the epanagnosticon sermon, which was spoken to the bishops themselves by Photius, the invader of the throne of Constantinople, who is full of all sweetness and doctrine, in the dissension of the schismatics, as follows: |
| 450 | Capitulum XXIV. | Chapter XXIV. |
| 450 | «Multae quidem communes passiones sunt, quas praecedentibus diebus audiens et intuens a deo provectum imperium nostrum lugere ac contristari operae pretium duxit. | Many common sufferings are indeed those which, having heard and seen the progress of our empire from God, have caused it to lament and grieve. |
| 450 | Maius autem malum et calamitatum arx est ecclesiae tempestas, malignus aspirans adversus eam diaboli turbo, pacis expulsio et veteris ordinis dissolutio, ausus irruendi iunioris in seniorem et inhonorati adversus honorabilem, ac omnimoda subversio status ecclesiastici, et apud exteriores quidem in conciliis iustitia conversante, apud ecclesiam iniustitia fiducialiter agens, amor principatus ac amor privatus, atque nullius severitatis propter haec reputatio, necnon et contra spiritualem patrem rabies et insania. | But the greater evil and the citadel of calamities is the tempest of the Church, the malignant whirlwind of the devil, the expulsion of peace and the dissolution of the old order, the audacity of the younger against the elder, and the unseemly against the honorable, and the total subversion of the ecclesiastical status, and, in the councils, justice conversing with outsiders, in the Church, acting with confidence in injustice, and the love of rule and private love, and no severity because of these, and also the rage and madness against the spiritual father. |
| 451 | Haec sunt, quae meam obtinebant et turbabant animam et tamquam nubes crassa obtenebrabant animum ac oculos cogebant fontes mihi lacrimarum largiri, et divinitatem in auxilium et solutionem exsistentis maeroris invocabam. | These are the things that held and troubled my soul, and, like a thick cloud, obscured my mind and forced my eyes to shed tears, and I invoked the divinity for help and solution from the existing sorrow. |
| 451 | Et opus erat mihi ac cogitatio, si forte possem in primis de ecclesiastica curam gerere unitate, quod et factum est et in effectum devenit, quemadmodum et vos omnes nostis, quotquot ad sacrum hoc convenistis collegium. | And it was necessary for me to think and consider, if perhaps I could first attend to the ecclesiastical care in unity, which was done and came to effect, as you all know, who have come to this sacred assembly. |
| 451 | Aliud enim imperii, quod sub me est, dimittens ad id solum in exordiis acceleravi, et secundum utriusque dissidentium partis petitionem et priscam ecclesiasticam traditionem perspiciendi causa et iam iudices eorum, quae in ecclesia nostra gesta sunt, ex reliquis patriarchalibus thronis collegi, rem perficiens cooperatione sancti spiritus, quam multi quidem ante nos imperantium videre desideraverunt, ex aequo autem omnes minime consecuti sunt. | For I have laid aside the empire that is under me, and, for the sake of understanding the petition of both dissenting parties and the ancient ecclesiastical tradition, I have gathered the judges of what has been done in our Church from the remaining patriarchal thrones, and, by the cooperation of the holy spirit, I have completed the matter, which many of those who ruled before us have desired to see, but none of them have achieved equally. |
| 452 | Et quotquot pertinent ad ecclesiasticam unitatem ac ordinationem omnia sollerter a me peracta sunt, cum in nullo penitus imperiali manu <ac> potentia, ut quidam, parvum vel magnum effecerim. | And all things that pertain to ecclesiastical unity and ordination have been carefully carried out by me, with no imperial hand or power, as some might think, having achieved anything, whether great or small. |
| 452 | Neque enim, ut sacratissimus patriarcha ad proprium regrederetur thronum, imperii mei opus vel excogitatio facta est, sed multum ante sanctissimus et beatissimus papa Nicolaus, quae circa illum erant certissime discens, synodice decrevit reddi ei ius proprii throni et anathema cum tota sancta Romanorum ecclesia pronuntiavit contra resistentes huiusmodi decreto atque sententiae. | For it was not my imperial work or thought that the most sacred patriarch should return to his own throne, but rather the most holy and blessed Pope Nicholas, who had certainly learned about the matters concerning him, decreed synodically that his right to the throne should be restored, and with the entire holy Roman Church, he pronounced an anathema against those who resisted this decree and sentence. |
| 453 | Hoc autem nos olim scientes et paventes iudicium anathematis promulgati obsecundare synodico iudicio Romanae ecclesiae necessarium duximus, et huius rei gratia reddidimus ei proprium thronum. | But we, knowing and fearing the judgment of the promulgated anathema, deemed it necessary to obey the synodical judgment of the Roman Church, and for this reason, we restored his own throne to him. |
| 453 | Verum non modo Romanae, sed et ad orientem solem sitarum sedium providentia meliori, [id est superiori,] vicarii pervenerunt nihil deinceps vel impedire vel adversari aut favere utrique parti iustissimo imperio nostro consensuro. | Indeed, not only the providence of the Roman Church, but also that of the eastern churches, situated towards the rising sun, has reached a better, that is, superior, level of understanding, so that nothing may henceforth hinder or oppose, or even favor, either party, and our most just empire may consent. |
| 453 | Cuius rei gratia in nullo synodico iudicio inveniri voluit, multorum garrulitates recidens, ne quis dixerit, quod imperialis manus et gladii et protectores ac mundanus potentatus concilium subadulteraverit. | For this reason, it was desired that no synodical judgment should be found, cutting off the chatter of many, lest anyone should say that the imperial hand, swords, protectors, and worldly power had suborned the council. |
| 453 | Unum solum nobis desiderium et ad praefatos iudices, postquam illos vidimus, supplicatio fuit, ne quemquam permitterent deperire vel ab ecclesia dei quemquam, si fieri posset, proici. | Our one desire and supplication to the aforementioned judges, after we saw them, was that they should not permit anyone to perish or be cast out of the Church of God, if it were possible. |
| 454 | Hoc solum est nostrum, si voluerit quis nominare, crimen. | This alone is our crime, if anyone wishes to call it that. |
| 454 | Alia vero omnia canonibus et hiis, quibus imperium synodi creditum est, tradidimus, multum pro praesenti iudicio coniurantes et condempnantes, id est condempnationem imprecantes, nil ad gratiam vel per odium decernendum, humane autem magis circa eos, qui ceciderant, affectandum, quos non proprie tantum, sed et communiter hodie omnibus videntibus deprecamur manum hiis, qui compassione opus habent, porrigere et unam ecclesiam celebrantium festivitatem perficere. | But all other things we have entrusted to the canons and to those to whom the imperial synod has been entrusted, conjuring and condemning much for the present judgment, that is, invoking condemnation, deciding nothing out of favor or hatred, but rather showing human affection towards those who have fallen, whom we beseech, not only privately but also publicly, before all who see, to extend a helping hand to those in need of compassion and to perfect the celebration of one Church. |
| 455 | Ita, patres spirituales et veritatis defensores, qui figuratis secundum chrisma Aaron et secundum zelum Finees ac secundum iudicium Salomonem, requirite ovem, quae perierat, convertite, quae erraverat. | Thus, spiritual fathers and defenders of truth, who are figured according to the anointing of Aaron, and according to the zeal of Phineas, and according to the judgment of Solomon, seek the sheep that has perished, convert the one that has erred. |
| 455 | Super humerum tollite solitariam et compassionis vinculis alligate. | Take up on your shoulder the solitary one and bind her with the chains of compassion. |
| 455 | Quae ulcerata est, emplastro condescensionis sanate. | Heal the one that is ulcerated with the plaster of condescension. |
| 455 | Quae extranea et abiecta est a spirituali mandra, nonaginta novem ovibus dispensationis more coniungite. | Join the one that is foreign and rejected from the spiritual fold to the ninety-nine sheep, in the manner of dispensation. |
| 455 | Relinquite memoriam sempiternam posterioribus generationibus compassionis vestrae ad imitationem Christi. | Leave a lasting memory of your compassion to future generations, in imitation of Christ. |
| 455 | Et vos quoque, qui curationis indigetis ac medela opus habetis, pretiosa membra Christi, etsi nescio quomodo a malo daemone detenti, a capite separati estis, vitis vera, quae propter contentionem importunam, immo vero iniustam, in amaritudinem conversa es, amici et proximi nostri, et si propter odium irrationabile ex adverso appropiantes et stantes ac unitatem respuentes: suscipite admonitionis sermonem, non autem confundor dicere etiam deprecationis. | And you, too, who are in need of healing and require medicine, precious members of Christ, although I do not know how you have been detained by the evil demon and separated from the head, true vine, which has been turned to bitterness on account of the importunate, or rather unjust, contention, and you, our friends and neighbors, who are approaching and standing in opposition, and rejecting unity, receive the word of admonition, and I am not ashamed to say, also of deprecation. |
| 456 | In id enim nos adduxit misericordia, quam circa vos habemus. | For mercy has brought us to this point, which we have towards you. |
| 456 | Scrutamini intima conscientiae vestrae, et invenietis male vos ab ecclesia esse disiunctos. | Examine the innermost recesses of your conscience, and you will find that you have been wrongly separated from the Church. |
| 456 | Novissima hora est, et iudex prae foribus est, fratres, ne praeoccupemur ab eius ecclesia sequestrati et longe ab illius gloria proiciamur. | The final hour is at hand, and the judge is at the door, brothers, lest we be preoccupied by being separated from his Church and cast far from his glory. |
| 456 | Nihil turpe ducamus passionem manifestare et vulnus ostendere ac locum paenitentiae et medicinae requirere atque intra atrium salvantium fieri, ne confusionem oboedientiam arbitrando confusionis aeternae sumamus experimentum. | Let us not consider it shameful to reveal our passion and show our wound, and to seek the place of penance and medicine, and to be made within the atrium of the saved, lest, thinking obedience is confusion, we experience the confusion of eternal damnation. |
| 457 | Qualis autem est confusio, fratres, procidere deo et veniam expetere? | What kind of confusion is it, brothers, to fall before God and seek forgiveness? |
| 457 | Deo enim procidunt, qui ecclesiae et spiritualibus istis patribus procidunt. | For those who fall before the Church and these spiritual fathers fall before God. |
| 457 | Confusio quidem revera est et maximus pudor, immo vero in deum dimicatio, nolle unumquemque proprium confiteri peccatum et humiliari propter Christum ac lucrari et se et multos. | Confusion is indeed true shame, and the greatest shame, or rather, a fight against God, not to confess one's own sin and humble oneself for the sake of Christ, and to gain both oneself and many others. |
| 458 | Si autem omnino hoc confusionem arbitramini, ego, cui imperii superposita est corona, forma vobis efficiar huius optimae humilitatis. | But if you consider this to be confusion, I, to whom the crown of empire has been bestowed, will be a model for you of this excellent humility. |
| 458 | Ego, qui imperitus et insipiens sum, bonum &laddinitium&radd ero vestrum, qui sapientes estis et scientia clari. | I, who am unskilled and foolish, will be your good example, you who are wise and renowned for your knowledge. |
| 458 | Ego, qui in peccatis volutatus sum, primus vobis typus fiam, qui mundi estis, et virtuti operam datis. | I, who have been rolled in sins, will be the first to set an example for you, who are pure and devoted to virtue. |
| 458 | Ego primus memet super pavimentum proicio purpuram et diadema parvipendens. | I will be the first to throw myself to the ground, trampling underfoot the purple and the diadem. |
| 458 | Ascendite ad genas meas et per oculos meos incedite, nec reputetis magnum imperatoris calcare scapulas, neque vereamini pedibus tangere verticem, cui superimponitur a deo donata corona. | Come and walk on my eyes, and do not consider it a great thing to tread on the shoulders of the emperor, nor be afraid to touch the head on which the crown, given by God, has been placed. |
| 458 | Omnia pati promptum habeo, quae vobis quidem confusionem, mihi autem gloriam et maximam claritatem conferre videntur. | I am ready to endure all things that may seem to you to be confusion, but to me are glory and the greatest clarity. |
| 458 | Neque enim in hoc curam gero gloriae meae, tantum ut videam communem unitatem et unam ecclesiam festivitatem celebrantium, tantum ne animae detrimentum patiar et gaudeat super me ille omnium inimicus diabolus, captivum sumens. | For I do not care about my own glory, as long as I see the common unity and the celebration of one Church, and I do not wish to suffer the loss of souls and have the enemy of all, the devil, rejoice over me, taking me captive. |
| 458 | Quod mihi desiderandum est, tantum spei meae lampas insperate non extinguatur, per quam festinabam communi illustrari laetitia simul et gaudio. | What I desire is that the lamp of my hope not be extinguished, through which I was hastening to be illuminated by common joy and gladness. |
| 458 | Nescio, quod erat satagendum et efficiendum, et non feci, vel quos proponendos admonitionis et deprecationis sermones, et non proposui. | I do not know what I should have done or accomplished, or what words of admonition and deprecation I should have proposed, and did not propose. |
| 458 | Vos ergo videbitis, innocens enim sum a perditione vestra. | You, therefore, will see that I am innocent of your perdition. |
| 459 | Si vero et ad magnum et horrendum illud iudicium futurae diei nos remittitis quasi pro vobis rationem daturos, noscite, quia bene novi, quod nullus vobis iustitiae sermo sive hic adest sive illic aderit, nisi quantum in hac controversia inventum exstiterit. | But if you send us to that great and terrible judgment of the future day, as if to give an account on your behalf, know that I well understand that no word of justice will be spoken to you, either here or there, except what has been found in this controversy. |
| 459 | Verum si vultis et ante illud iudicium conscientiae vestrae interrogare iudicium, discetis nihil amplius, quam quod ab imperio nostro dicitur. | But if you wish to examine the judgment of your conscience before that judgment, you will learn nothing more than what our empire says. |
| 460 | Deponite igitur contentionem, fratres, et resumite amorem fraternitatis. | Therefore, lay aside contention, brothers, and resume the love of brotherhood. |
| 460 | Fugite dissensionem et unitatem amplectimini. | Flee dissension and embrace unity. |
| 460 | Odium avertite et dilectionem in sinu recipite. | Avert hatred and receive love in your heart. |
| 460 | State cum probabilibus et capiti compangimini. | Stand with the probable and mourn with the head. |
| 460 | Recipite per parentiam divinae communionis gratiam et nihil ob saecularia sitis solliciti. | Receive the grace of divine communion through parenthood, and do not be solicitous about worldly things. |
| 461 | Sunt enim apud compatientissimum imperium nostrum susceptionum [id est auxiliarum] modi diversi, per quos vos consolabimur et incessanter, quae secundum saeculum vobis opportuna fuerint, faciemus. | For there are various modes of reception and assistance in our most compassionate empire, through which we will comfort you and continually do what is opportune for you according to the world. |
| 461 | Rursusque multimode decertabimus, obsecrantes, rogantes et omne ingenium commoventes ad spirituales patres vestros et patriarchas, ut dispensent quid eorum, quae insunt animo vestro, tantum ne temere contra salutem vestram agatis. | And we will strive in many ways, beseeching, asking, and stirring up every device, to your spiritual fathers and patriarchs, that they may dispense some of what is in your mind, provided that you do not act rashly against your own salvation. |
| 461 | Non enim est tempus ad paenitentiam et receptionem praesenti acceptius. | For the present time is most acceptable for repentance and reception. |
| 461 | Qui namque hodie ligare ac solvere ecclesiae negotia possunt, praesto sunt. | Those who can bind and loose the affairs of the Church are at hand. |
| 461 | Dimittite importune tempus explorare et rerum immutationem exspectare, quae, etsi fiat aliquando, nihil vobis conferet. | Cease to explore the time importunately and to expect a change of circumstances, which, even if it happens, will bring you nothing. |
| 462 | Etenim etsi alia tempus immutaverit, hoc commovere non poterit. | For even if time changes other things, it will not be able to change this. |
| 462 | Nam si actio unius viri vestri nil rationabile habens, cum tota erronea esset, tantum aestum operata est, ut hunc vix ac difficili dissolvere quiverimus, actionem dic mihi et iudicium quattuor patriarchalium sedium quis dissolvere poterit? | For if the action of one of your men, having no reasonable basis, and being entirely erroneous, has nevertheless had such an effect that we can hardly and with difficulty dissolve it, what judgment and decision of the four patriarchal sees will be able to dissolve it? |
| 462 | Ad quem enim fugietis solutionem obligamenti petentes? | To whom will you flee, seeking a solution to the obligation? |
| 462 | Ad Romanum praesulem? | To the Roman prelate? |
| 462 | Sed finetenus vos condempnavit. | But he has already condemned you. |
| 462 | Ad Antiochenum? | To the Antiochene? |
| 462 | Sed consentaneus Romano et consonus factus est. | But he has become consistent with the Roman and has agreed with him. |
| 462 | Ad Hierosolymitanum vel Alexandrinum? | To the Hierosolymitan or Alexandrian? |
| 462 | Sedes illae vestrae dampnationi consenserunt. | Those sees have consented to your condemnation. |
| 462 | Ac si et thronum aliquando Constantinopolitanum ille, qui cuncta violat, vobis commiserit, et per vosmet ipsos convenire volueritis, quis vos sequetur, vel quomodo aperire oculos et aspicere quempiam poteritis, impugnati ab omnibus sacerdotibus ac patriarchalibus sedibus? | And even if the Constantinopolitan throne, which violates all things, should sometime be entrusted to you, and you should wish to come together through yourselves, who will follow you, or how will you be able to open your eyes and look at anyone, being attacked by all the priests and patriarchal sees? |
| 463 | Ne ergo, fratres, ipsi vos decipientes tempus salutis vestrae perdatis, neque enim tale invenietis aliquando, sed importunas contentiones et obstinationes deserentes communi medelae occurrite et medicinae remedium sumite, ac adhaerete spirituali capiti nostro et ecclesiae dei communicatores estote, ut et crimine exuamini et deum propitium habeatis ac ecclesiam laetificetis imperiumque nostrum exsultari ac spiritualiter festivitatem celebrare faciatis atque rem publicam universam gaudio maximo et tripudio repleatis, necnon et in communi omnes benedicamus pariter domino, gloriae nostrae ac principi pacis, et auctori dispersa congreganti et bene coaptanti, intercessionibus sanctissimae dominae nostrae dei genitricis deum videntium angelorum et omnium sanctorum. | Lest, therefore, brothers, you yourselves, being deceived, lose the time of your salvation, and indeed you will not find such an opportunity again, but leaving behind importunate contentions and obstinacies, hasten to the common remedy and medicine, and adhere to our spiritual head and be communicants of the church of God, so that you may be freed from crime and have a propitious God, and gladden the church, and make our empire exult and spiritually celebrate a festival, and fill the entire republic with the greatest joy and triumph, and also, let us all bless the Lord together, the glory of our prince and the author of peace, who gathers and unites the dispersed, through the intercessions of our most holy lady, the mother of God, and the angels who see God, and all the saints. |
| 463 | Amen. | Amen. |
| 464 | Post lectionem vero ascendens Theodorus a secretis vicariorum senioris Romae legit: «Ecce quomodo suavissimus et Christianissimus imperator divinitus sibi concesso imperio non vult perire unam ovem a Christo sibi ad custodiam creditam, transferens omne exsilium, omnem tribulationem et omnem angustiam in admonitionem et precem. | After the reading, Theodorus, ascending from the secrets of the senior vicars of Rome, read: "Behold, how the most sweet and Christian emperor, to whom the divine empire has been granted, does not wish one sheep entrusted to him by Christ to perish, transferring all exile, all tribulation, and all anguish into admonition and prayer." |
| 465 | Ecce qua humanitate uti debet imperator et cum diligentia curare debet, ne perdat etiam unam sibi creditam ovem. | Behold, with what humanity the emperor ought to act and with what diligence he ought to care, lest he lose even one sheep entrusted to him. |
| 465 | Utere, o successor Basilii, Sigismunde piissime, tua connata clementia et huius iam lecti formam tuo perdulci eloquio, ut soles, applica. | Use, O successor of Basil, most pious Sigismund, your innate clemency, and apply the form of this already read text to your most sweet eloquence, as you are accustomed to do. |
| 465 | Attrahe itaque prece ac omni humanitate, qui exciderunt a salutis via, maxime incliti regni Bohemiae incolas, et tibi serviet apologus iste de verbo ad verbum per omnia pondera. | Attract, therefore, with prayer and all humanity, those who have fallen away from the path of salvation, especially the most illustrious inhabitants of the kingdom of Bohemia, and this apology will serve you word for word in all respects. |
| 465 | Quanto studio prisci sancti imperatores fidei orthodoxae augmentum maxima cura praestiterunt, non sit tua minor in conservandis dudum ecclesiae incorporatis. | With how much zeal the ancient holy emperors took the greatest care to augment the orthodox faith, let your care not be less in preserving those who have long been incorporated into the church. |
| 465 | Fiant possibilia omnia per pietatis et clementiae vias. | Let all things be possible through the ways of piety and clemency. |
| 465 | Dum hoc Christus ecclesiae sponsus viderit, dabit si ne dubio caritativae imprecationi mirandum effectum. | While Christ, the spouse of the church, sees this, he will give a marvelous effect to the charitable prayer, without a doubt. |
| 465 | Dum enim ea, quae ipsa humilitas deposcit, ordinate fiunt, victoria bellica numquam deficiet. | For when those things that humility demands are done in an orderly manner, military victory will never be lacking. |
| 465 | Non poterunt pertinaces, elati, diabolici armatis Christi caritate ac humilitate et eius solum honorem quaerentibus deesse. | The obstinate, the haughty, and the diabolical will not be able to resist those who are armed with the charity and humility of Christ and who seek only his honor. |
| 466 | Age, Christianissime princeps, ut medio huius sacri concilii per tua dulcissima placatoria suasa crudelis feritas eorum mansuescat. | Act, most Christian prince, so that in the midst of this sacred council, through your most sweet placatory exhortations, the cruel ferocity of those people may be tamed. |
| 466 | Et tunc, etsi non poterit spiritus domini repente infundi, tractabiles effecti dietim ex cotidiana communione ipsorum et Christi fidelium revertentur ad cor et demum videbunt se stultos in eo, quod propriae prudentiae innitentes se contra communem catholicorum sententiam superbe erexerunt. | And then, even if the spirit of the Lord cannot be suddenly infused, they will become tractable, and from daily communion with them and the faithful of Christ, they will return to their heart and finally see that they were foolish in relying on their own prudence and proudly opposing the common sentiment of the Catholics. |
| 467 | Oportet autem hanc rem maxima diligentia et indefesse infinitis mediis tractare, ut demum vincatur ille nefandus satan, qui possessa aliquamdiu ipsorum corda non facile deserit. | But it is necessary to handle this matter with the greatest diligence and indefatigable means, so that finally that nefarious Satan, who has possessed their hearts for a long time, may be vanquished. |
| 467 | Habes tu, princeps, supernum admirandum donum ad instar tui typum gerentis Basilii, ut schismatica quaeque ad unitatem non sine profundissima prudentia et fatigiis multis reducas. | You, prince, have a supernatural and admirable gift, similar to that of Basil, to reduce schismatic things to unity, not without the deepest prudence and many labors. |
| 467 | Hoc Constantiae, dum in pontificibus Romanis contentio schismatica inolevit, egit tua regalis sapientia, quod Basilius in patriarchis Constantinopolitanis Photio et Ignatio adversariis Constantinopolitana octava synodo egit. | Your royal wisdom did this at Constance, while the schismatic contention was growing among the Roman pontiffs, which Basil did in the case of the patriarchs of Constantinople, Photius and Ignatius, at the eighth synod of Constantinople. |
| 467 | Hoc insuper in hoc sacratissimo Basiliensi concilio studuisti non absque gravissimis laboribus ad unitatem reducere inter membra ecclesiae et caput nostrum Eugenium Romanum sanctissimum papam, quod ipse Basilius inter se Ignatio in concilio alio Constantinopolitano opponentes subiectos episcopos perfecit. | Moreover, in this most sacred council of Basel, you have striven, not without the most serious labors, to reduce to unity the members of the church and our head, Eugene, the most holy Roman pope, which Basil himself accomplished among the subject bishops who opposed Ignatius in another council of Constantinople. |
| 468 | Nunc restat, ut alios, qui supersunt in regno tuo Bohemiae inclito et florenti, paucis ante hoc annis per reductionem perficias, quod idem ipse Basilius de ipsis iconomachis et imagines Christi et sanctorum destruentibus et earum venerationem dampnantibus, quorum multi Bohemi sectatores exsistunt, laudabiliter adimplevit. | Now it remains that you perfect the others who remain in your illustrious and flourishing kingdom of Bohemia, which the same Basil laudably accomplished regarding the iconomachs and those who destroyed and condemned the veneration of the images of Christ and the saints, many of whose followers exist in Bohemia. |
| 468 | Non absque divina ordinatione hoc tempore ecclesiae tempestati multum illi tempori, dum Basilius imperio praeesset, aequalis pro salute praefectus es, ut eiusdem vestigia insequens, idem quod ipse deo inspirante perageres. | Not without divine ordination, you are the prefect of the church in this tempestuous time, similar to the time when Basil presided over the empire, so that following in his footsteps, you may accomplish the same things, inspired by God. |
| 468 | Sed vacua est exhortatio currenti, ut currat. | But exhortation is empty to one who is already running, that he may run. |
| 468 | Multo te natura sagax ac religiosus cultus ad haec sancta opera plus sollicitat, quam extranea quaecumque etiam eruditissima persuasio. | Your nature, wise and religiously cultivated, solicits you more to these holy works than any external, even most erudite, persuasion. |
| 468 | Ideo non amplius fatigandus es verbis, imperator optime, ut operi vaces. | Therefore, you should not be fatigued with words, best emperor, so that you may attend to the work. |
| 469 | Capitulum XXV. | Chapter XXV. |
| 469 | Esset hoc loco late tractandum iuxta praemissa de imperiali concilio, in quo imperialia illa, quae ad regimen bonum rei publicae spectant, maturo digesto consilio ex omnium elicito consensu in leges redigi deberent. | This matter should be treated at length here, according to what has been said before, about the imperial council, in which those imperial things that pertain to the good governance of the republic should be reduced to laws through mature and digested counsel, elicited from the consensus of all. |
| 469 | Sed quia universalis synodus sacerdotum proprie ad instar se huius habet, cuius iam superius et qualitatum suarum omnium descriptionem praemisimus, ideo facile nos expediemus. | But since the universal synod of priests has this same thing, whose description of all its qualities we have premised above, therefore we will easily expedite ourselves. |
| 470 | Scimus imperatorem caput et primum omnium, apud quem est imperialis iussio de congregandis subditis regibus et principibus. | We know that the emperor is the head and the first of all, with whom is the imperial command to congregate the subject kings and princes. |
| 470 | Hii vero, qui ut membra ad ipsum caput concurrere habent, in hoc universali imperiali concilio sunt principales, praesides provinciarum suas provincias repraesentantes ac etiam universitatum magnarum rectores et magistri et illi, qui e senatorio gradu, qui sacer conventus appellatur, exsistunt; quoniam vel illustres, qui primi ad latus et pars corporis eius sunt, 6 q. | These, indeed, who have to converge as members to the head, are the principals in this universal imperial council, the presidents of the provinces representing their provinces, and also the rectors and masters of the great universities, and those who exist from the senatorial grade, which is called the sacred convent; since they are either illustrious, who are the first and part of the body, or expectable, who are in the middle, or most clear, who are the lowest, beyond which grades no one is found in the senatorial assembly. |
| 470 | 1 § Si quis, vel exspectabiles, qui medii, vel clarissimi, qui infimi, ultra quos gradus inter senatorium coetum nullus inveniebatur, 2 q. | If anyone, whether expectable, who are in the middle, or most clear, who are the lowest, beyond which grades no one is found in the senatorial assembly. |
| 470 | 6 Anteriorum § Illud etiam. | Of the offices of these, in order, in the book of digests. |
| 470 | De quorum officiis per ordinem in libro digestorum. | The first order is that of kings and electors of the empire, patricians. |
| 471 | Primi ordinis sunt reges et electores imperii, patricii. | The second order is that of dukes, presidents, prefects, and the like. |
| 471 | Secundi sunt duces, praesides, praefecti et huiusmodi. | The third order is that of marquises, landgraves, and similar ones. |
| 471 | Tertii marchiones et lantgravii et similes. | All those who excel the others and are closer to the empire constitute the imperial body, whose head is the caesar himself. |
| 471 | Omnes illi, qui ceteris eminent et imperio plus approximantur, corpus imperiale, cuius caput est ipse caesar, constituunt. | And when they convene together in one representative assembly, the entire empire is collected, as the Lex Julia proves, "If anyone with soldiers". |
| 471 | Et dum simul conveniunt in uno compendio repraesentativo, totum imperium collectum est, ut hoc probat Lex Iulia § Si quis cum militibus, 6 q. | And the canonized text, as it is found in the law of majesty, chapter 1. |
| 471 | 1 canonizata, ut habetur Ad legem Iuliam maiestatis C. | Whoever, and the text of the eighth council, placed above in chapter XVII, where it is said: "When princes frequently convene assemblies for their own causes". |
| 471 | l. | And since universal decrees ought to be treated through consensus for the salvation of the empire, and also to this end, that the general law may not obstruct a part of the empire, so that true knowledge may be had of this, the aforementioned protoprinces and other most faithful sworn ones, convening, will be able to manifest each thing to be consulted at the opportune time and place, from clear knowledge, and then the conclusions of the digested council will be received with firm custody. |
| 471 | Quisquis et textus octavi concilii positus supra in XVII. | I have found in ancient books certain universal imperial councils celebrated, in which the princes, after the emperor, subscribed with their own hand for perpetual firmness, similar to what is accustomed to be done in ecclesiastical synods. |
| 471 | capitulo, ubi dicitur: Cum principes pro suis causis frequenter conventus agant. | I have also read the council of King Dagobert at Cologne with 24 princes, in which many necessary things were dictated for the conservation of justice and the best peace, with the consensus of all, and also the laws of Charlemagne, which were established by the counsel of the faithful, as the text proves, "Quicumque", and Hildebert and others. |
| 472 | Et quia per consensum universalia decreta oportet pro salute imperii tractare, ac etiam in eum finem, ut lex generalis non obsit parti imperii, ut de hoc vera notitia habeatur, praefati protoprincipes et ceteri fidelissimi iurati convenientes singula ad consultandum tempori et loco opportuna ex scientia clara poterint cunctis manifestare, et tunc sic digesto concilio conclusa firma custodia recipientur. | The universal council examined, gathered, and corrected, according to opportunity, and added, giving distinct observances to distinct places of our empire, to the Alemanni, indeed, others than to the Baiuvari, whom we today call Bavarians, and to the Ribuari, Burgundians, and Langobards, others, and it promulgated laws, which it called Salic, for the people of the Saxons and those regions. |
| 472 | Repperi ego in libris antiquis quaedam imperialia concilia universalia celebrata, in quibus se principes post imperatorem propria manu pro perpetua firmitate subscripsere, ad instar ut in ecclesiasticis synodis fieri solitum est. | I have seen all these collected in order and have experienced many of them, and especially the more important ones, in common use, from ancient introduction, with their forms, especially in rural judgments, rather than in towns and cities, on account of the municipal statutes that have supervened. |
| 473 | Concilium etiam Dagoberti regis Coloniae cum 24 principibus habitum legi, in quo multa necessaria et pro conservanda iustitia et pace optima dictata omnium consensu fuere, leges etiam Caroli Magni, quae consultu fidelium statuebantur, ut probat textus 11 q. | (Translation of 43, corrected to 44) |
| 473 | 1 Quicumque § Volumus, et Hildeberti ac aliorum. | (Translation of 44, corrected to 45) |
| 473 | Universale illud concilium examinavit, coadunavit et iuxta opportunitatem correxit et addidit, dans distinctis imperii nostri locis distinctas observantias, Alemannis quidem alias quam Baiuvariis, quos hodie Bavaros nominamus, Ribuariis etiam, Burgundionibus ac Langobardis alias ac alias edidit leges, quas Salicas dixit, pro Saxonum et illarum regionum populis. | (Translation of 45, corrected to 46) |
| 474 | Has ego vidi seriatim omnes collectas et expertus sum multas de illis, et maxime potiores, in vulgari usu ex antiqua introductione cum suis formis maxime in iudiciis ruralibus potius quam in oppidis et civitatibus propter forte supervenientia statuta municipalia haberi. | (Translation of 46, corrected to 47) |
| 475 | Talia concilia, qui conventus nuncupantur, omni anno aut bis aut semel lego antiquos reges pro bono publico celebrasse in diversis imperii civitatibus, et in illis punitiones strictissimae factae sunt in turbantes pacem et leges publicas, et maxime in periuris et fidem non servantibus. | Such councils, which are called assemblies, the ancient kings, every year or twice or once, are known to have celebrated for the public good in various provinces of the empire, and in them the severest punishments were inflicted on those disturbing the peace and public laws, and especially on perjurers and those who did not keep their faith. |
| 475 | Et timore horum conventuum, ad quos ex iuramento imperio praestito vocati venire tenebantur, diffidationes particulares, rapinae et incendia non committebantur. | And, fearing these assemblies, to which they were obliged to come, having sworn an oath to the empire, particular betrayals, robberies, and arson were not committed. |
| 476 | Nullus illud iudicium illius coetus aut vitare aut recusare potuit, et sententias ibi latas imperator cum coetu militari manu in non oboedientes executioni demandavit. | No one could avoid or refuse that judgment of that assembly, and the emperor, with the military assembly, entrusted the execution of the sentences passed there to those who did not obey. |
| 477 | Substantialia membra illius concilii sunt illi, qui principes imperii nominantur, sive illi sint episcopi vel laici vel abbates. | The essential members of that council are those who are called the princes of the empire, whether they be bishops, laymen, or abbots. |
| 477 | Alii vero de hoc concilio, nisi vocati particulariter, non fuere. | Others, however, of this council, unless specially summoned, were not present. |
| 477 | In fine cuiuslibet conventus rebus expeditis alteri futurae congregationi tempus et locus praefigebatur. | At the end of each assembly, with matters concluded, a time and place were set for a future gathering. |
| 477 | Erat nihilominus semper in imperatoris potestate locum et tempus praevenire occurrentibus causis. | Nevertheless, it was always in the emperor's power to anticipate the time and place due to arising circumstances. |
| 477 | Nulla umquam ordinatio melior et utilior universae profuit ecclesiae, non sub imperio tantum degentibus. | No better or more useful arrangement ever benefited the whole Church, not only those living under the empire. |
| 478 | Confluebant Romani pontificis legati pro causis ecclesiae, aliorum regum pro suis regni arduis negotiis instantibus, et salutari consilio cunctis necessitatibus publicis succurrebatur. | Legates of the Roman pontiff came together for the causes of the Church, those of other kings for their pressing affairs of the kingdom, and salutary counsel was given to meet all public needs. |
| 478 | Credo nullam rem regimini publico plus utilitatis affere posse quam reintroductionem illius sanctae observantiae. | I believe that no matter can bring more benefit to the public administration than the reintroduction of that sacred observance. |
| 479 | Et quod communi concilio sic dictanda pro summa firmitate subscriberentur aut signarentur aliqua cruce manu propria cuiuscumque, qui interesset, ut fieri solitum fuit hac lege, ut si quis umquam contra legem manu propria subscriptam aut signatam temere venire temptaverit, a fama cadat, et quod omni honore, tamquam in se ipsum et propriam fidem mendacissimus, eo ipso privatus exsistat. | And that the matters to be decreed by the common council, for the greatest firmness, should be subscribed or signed with a certain cross by the hand of each participant, as was customary by this law, so that if anyone ever attempts to act contrary to the law thus signed by his own hand, he may fall from favor, and that he may be deprived of all honor, as a liar against himself and his own faith, by that very act. |
| 480 | Haec fuit antiquorum observantia, quae illis pateri poterit, qui gesta regum et imperatorum ac praefata statuta eorum in conventibus absque taedio perlustraverint. | This was the observance of the ancients, which those who without weariness have examined the deeds of kings and emperors and their aforementioned statutes in the assemblies will be able to understand. |
| 481 | Non insisto de illius conventus ordinatione ad longum dicendo, est enim quoad ordinem sedium electorum per piissimae memoriae Carolum quartum ac eius Auream Bullam provisum in Metensi conventu. | I do not dwell on the order of the assembly's arrangement at length, for it has been provided, as regards the order of the elected seats, by the most pious memory of Charles the Fourth and his Golden Bull at the assembly at Mainz. |
| 481 | Sciunt ceteri principes iuxta dignitatem et senium loca sua. | The other princes, according to their dignity and age, know their places. |
| 481 | Dum vero assunt principes, fidelitatis iuramento ad ea, quae imperio et rei publicae meliora ac in occurrenti casu secundum conscientiae iudicium, omni sinistra affectione semota, prospexerint, interrogati libere quisque et intrepide palam edicat. | While the princes are present, they are questioned freely and fearlessly, publicly, about their oaths of fidelity to those things which are better for the empire and the state, and in any case, according to their judgment of conscience, with all evil affections removed. |
| 481 | Haec et alia ex superioribus in argumento similitudinis patescunt. | These and other matters from the above are evident in the argument of similarity. |
| 482 | Capitulum XXVI. | Chapter XXVI. |
| 482 | Ultimum membrum huius partis est inter cuncta difficillimum habens investigationes in experientiis potius quam litteratura simplici fundatas. | The last member of this part is among all the most difficult, having its investigations based more on experience than on simple literature. |
| 482 | Cuius partitio &laddprima&radd versatur circa sacri imperii statum florentis tempore, ut sic cognito excessus hodiernus et gradus ipsius lapsus perpendi possint. | The division of this part is concerned with the state of the Holy Roman Empire in a flourishing period, so that the excesses of the present day and the degree of its decline may be considered. |
| 482 | Post haec oportet remedia sanativa ex ingenii discursu, adiutorio principali ex priscis gestis sumpto, elicere et ipsa aperire, saltem ut meliora per consequentias illativas perquirantur gradatim. | After these things, it is necessary to elicit and reveal the healing remedies from the course of reason, taking principal assistance from the ancient deeds, at least so that better things may be sought by inductive consequences gradually. |
| 483 | Primum membrum est hiis notum, qui actus virtuosos imperatorum, qui ex hac inclita Germania gubernaculorum initia traxere, &laddnoverunt&radd. | The first member is known to those who have witnessed the virtuous deeds of the emperors who drew the beginnings of the rudders from this illustrious Germany. |
| 483 | Et ne ad remotissimos primos maximos imperatores orbis necesse habeamus recurrere, quoniam reductio reformativa non poterit pro nunc ad talem statum pertingere, missos eos faciamus et ab Ottone primo &laddinitium sumentes&radd, cui inter cunctos umquam imperatores prima vera suprema – absque diminutione et condicione – imperialis potestas pro se et suis successoribus tam a senatu Romano et toto populo quam papa cum sua synodo tradita legitur. | And so that we need not resort to the most remote first great emperors of the world, since the reformative reduction cannot for now reach such a state, let us make them messengers and take the beginning from Otto the First, to whom among all the emperors the true supreme imperial power, without diminution and condition, is read to have been handed over for himself and his successors by the Roman Senate and the whole people, as well as by the Pope with his Synod. |
| 483 | Tunc enim in tantum conquassatum fuit occidentale imperium variis tyrannice ipsum invadentibus, quod non nisi hoc pacto perpetuitatis imperii et restitutionis omnium donatorum ecclesiae Romanae ipsum, etiam pure oblatum, acceptare nollet. | For then the Western Empire was so shaken by various tyrants invading it, that it would not accept this way of perpetuating the empire and restoring all the gifts to the Roman Church, even if offered purely. |
| 483 | Factis itaque hiis omnibus ad votum Ottonis dietim omnia dominia divino adiutorio devenerunt sub sua potestate, scilicet regnum Italiae et Langobardorum, regnum Burgundionum, habito prius Germanorum regno, cuius primus rex pater eius Henricus legitur fuisse. | Thus, having done all these things to the wish of Otto, all the dominions daily came under his power by divine assistance, namely, the kingdom of Italy and the Lombards, the kingdom of Burgundy, having previously held the kingdom of the Germans, of whom his father Henry is said to have been the first king. |
| 484 | Volunt bene quidam Ottonem secundum ex secunda uxore Ottonis, filia regis Burgundiae, natum ad possessionem illius Burgundionum regni hereditario iure devenisse, verumtamen proposito nostro sufficit scire ex illis regnis ac dominiis praetactis imperium nostrum collectum, in quo summa fides et constantia servata legitur. | Some wish Otto the Second, born of Otto's second wife, the daughter of the king of Burgundy, to have come to the possession of that kingdom of Burgundy by hereditary right, but for our purpose it suffices to know that our empire was collected from those kingdoms and dominions, in which supreme faith and constancy are seen to have been preserved. |
| 485 | Etiam catholicae fidei Hungari, Bohemi, Dani, Norwegi, Sarmati, Prusi et ceterae magnae provinciae post haec tempora nostris imperantibus subiectae reperiuntur. | Also, the Hungarians, Bohemians, Danes, Norwegians, Sarmatians, Prussians, and other great provinces are found subject to our rulers after these times. |
| 485 | Summa enim omnium imperantium cura in custodia fidei fuit et eius augmento. | For the care of all the emperors was in the custody and increase of faith. |
| 486 | Regebatur autem imperium imperative, quoniam vox imperialis potentia et vigore armabatur. | The empire was governed imperatively, since the imperial voice was armed with power and strength. |
| 486 | Non erat lex, quam impune etiam maximus transire posset. | There was no law which the greatest could transgress with impunity. |
| 486 | Nisi enim lex censuram ac pungitivam acutiem retineat, obtunditur et in desuetudinem abit. | For if the law does not retain its censure and sharp sting, it is blunted and falls into disuse. |
| 486 | Oportet enim, quod appetitus noxius freno legis teneatur et infra eius terminos limitetur. | For it is necessary that harmful desires be restrained by the bridle of the law and limited within its boundaries. |
| 486 | Lex sine coerctione censuram non habens vitam perdidit nec lex dici meretur, sicut nec mortuus homo. | A law without coercion, having no censure, has lost its life and does not deserve to be called a law, just as a dead man does not. |
| 486 | Tunc quidem vigebant leges et timebantur imperialia statuta et, ut severitas legum continuo usu fortificaretur, annui et maximi principum conventus indicti fuere, in quibus nullus quantaecumque potentiae legis transgressor impunitus abscessit. | Then indeed the laws were in force and the imperial statutes were feared, and, so that the severity of the laws might be strengthened by continuous use, annual and great assemblies of the princes were called, in which no transgressor of the law, however powerful, departed unpunished. |
| 487 | Oportebat quidem non imperialem tantum, sed omnium principum, immo parentum et amicissimorum sententiam aequanimiter tolerare. | It was necessary indeed to tolerate the judgment of not only the emperor, but of all princes, indeed of parents and closest friends, with equanimity. |
| 487 | Non poterat quisquam in conventu ob iusiurandum imperio praestitum statutam legem interrogatus non approbare et non laudare et per eam occurrentem casum etiam contra filium non iudicare. | No one could, in the assembly, having sworn an oath to the empire, be questioned and not approve and praise the established law, and not judge even a son by it in any case that arose. |
| 487 | Sed erat necessarium secundum legem unam omnium sententiam et proferri et executioni mandari. | But it was necessary, according to the law, for the judgment of all to be both pronounced and carried out. |
| 487 | Sic absque partialitate ex communi concordia legalis sanctio censuram obtinuit. | Thus, without partiality, by common agreement, the legal sanction obtained its censure. |
| 487 | Nec poterat sua libertate quisquam eandem impune transgredi. | Nor could anyone transgress it with impunity by his own liberty. |
| 487 | Ex hoc pax communis et patria felix. | From this, common peace and a happy homeland. |
| 488 | Capitulum XXVII. | Chapter XXVII. |
| 488 | Subsequenter Otto secundus, unico gaudens filio et multis regnis cogitans difficile fore absque maximo labore tot regna in pace aliquamdiu servari posse insequens vestigia avi sui Henrici primi ac Ottonis patris eius cogitatum ad res ecclesiasticas appulit, considerans multa iam religiosis locis per praeteritos reges donata summa pace gaudere, quia verecundum erat deo dicatis vim inferre. | Subsequently, Otto the Second, rejoicing in a single son and considering it difficult to keep so many kingdoms in peace for any length of time without great labor, following in the footsteps of his grandfather Henry the First and his father Otto, turned his attention to ecclesiastical matters, considering that many places dedicated to religion had already been given by previous kings and enjoyed great peace, because it was shameful to inflict violence on those dedicated to God. |
| 488 | Animo ponderavit ordinationem sanctae synodi Romanae ecclesiae, de qua 63 di. | He weighed the ordinance of the Holy Synod of the Roman Church, of which 63 days. |
| 488 | In synodo, per quam perpetua dabatur potestas imperatoribus et Romanum pontificem et cunctos sub imperio episcopos investiendi, vel saltem eorum consensum semper concurrere debere celebrata canonica electione, ut 63 di. | In the Synod, by which perpetual power was given to the emperors and the Roman pontiff and all bishops under the empire to invest, or at least their consent should always concur in the canonical election, as 63 days. |
| 488 | Nos sanctorum. | We of the saints. |
| 489 | Unde hoc ponderans credidit perpetuis temporibus imperio subiectis pacem dari posse, si temporalia dominia tam Romanae ecclesiae quam aliis adiungerentur cum certi servitii observantia. | Weighing this, he believed that peace could be given to those subject to the empire for all time if the temporal domains of the Roman Church and others were joined with the observance of a certain service. |
| 489 | Tunc enim cultum divinum augmentari et religionem in magnam reverentiam exaltari credidit, quando sanctissimi episcopi magnae potentiae aliis principibus intermiscerentur. | For then he believed that divine worship would be increased and religion exalted to great reverence, when most holy bishops of great power were mixed with other princes. |
| 489 | Non posset tunc sua quisque voluntate in peccatis uti, nulla publica sperabat umquam peccata raptorum et depopulatorum agrorum et communem pacem turbantium, incendiariorum et consimilium posse nutriri ecclesiastica sacra potestate potenti et valenti resistente. | Then no one could use his own will in sins; he hoped that no public sins of rapists and destroyers of fields and disturbers of common peace, arsonists, and the like could ever be nourished, with the powerful and strong ecclesiastical sacred power resisting. |
| 489 | Etiam praedones ac pauperum depressores, qui particulari regimini praeessent, sic corrigi posse aestimabat, ut sic absque tyrannica oppressione populus in libertate vivere posset imperio etiam tranquillissimo. | He also judged that robbers and oppressors of the poor, who presided over a particular government, could be corrected in such a way that the people could live in freedom without tyrannical oppression, even under a most peaceful empire. |
| 490 | Non dubitabat hanc ordinationem utilissimam, quando per annua servitia ac praestimonias cuilibet ecclesiae iuxta quantitatem temporaliorum &laddindictas&radd status imperialis manuteneretur, ac etiam maior multo imperii potentia ex hoc appareret, quod illis omnibus dominiis ita ecclesiis traditis nullus nisi per imperium et absque successione praefici posset immo et deponi, si non sancte et canonice viveret, quando ad imperatoris aut synodi accusationem episcoporum aliorum cognitio interveniret. | He did not doubt that this arrangement was most useful, when each church, according to the quantity of its temporal possessions and the status of the imperial estate, was to be maintained by annual services and payments, and even the power of the empire would appear greater, since none but by imperial decree and without succession could be appointed or removed as ruler, unless he lived in a holy and canonical manner; when the accusation of bishops by the emperor or the synod intervened. |
| 490 | Et ita parum videbantur illa temporalia ab imperialibus manibus abscedere, quae semper in eius potestate hoc ordine cum magno proficuo rei publicae permanebant. | Thus, these temporal possessions seemed little to separate from the hands of the emperors, which always remained in this order with great benefit to the commonwealth. |
| 491 | Capitulum XXVIII. | Chapter XXVIII. |
| 491 | Ordinabantur etiam tunc principes, duces et comites constitui debere tamquam officia publica imperiali iussione habentes, ad nutum removibiles, rationem sui ministerii aerario publico reddentes. | Princes, dukes, and counts were also ordered to be established as public offices, holding them by imperial command and being removable at will, rendering an account of their service to the public treasury. |
| 491 | Post haec, quia senatorum filii, licet equestres primo forent, tamen ad senatum demum perveniebant, introductum fuit, ut parentibus rite in officio se habentibus filii eodem officio non privarentur. | After this, since the sons of senators were equestrians at first, but only reached the senate, it was introduced that the sons of parents properly holding office should not be deprived of the same office. |
| 491 | Ad illum finem, ut patres minus avaritiae studerent, non habentes de successione in officio securitatem, et etiam, ut eorum subiecti minus tunc gravarentur per patrem, quando et ipsis sui posteri praeesse deberent. | To this end, that fathers would study less avarice, not having security of succession in office, and also, so that their subjects would be less burdened by their father when they themselves should have to rule their descendants. |
| 491 | Tamen, ut imperiali celsitudini nulla incommoda detractoria dominiorum in futurum crescente potestate officiatorum exorirentur, feudalia sunt introducta statuta et de fide servanda strictissima iuramenta, quae per unumquemque vassallorum instituendorum praestari et sub poena perditionis feudi inviolabiliter servari deberent. | However, so that no detractors of the imperial dignity might arise from the lords in the future, growing power of the officials, feudal statutes were introduced and extremely strict oaths of fealty, which through one and all vassals were to be sworn and inviolably to be kept under penalty of forfeiture of the fief. |
| 492 | Est denique alia lex edita ad magna feuda plura nullum accumulative succedere posse, ne sic plura magna accumulando potentia subditorum in tantum excresceret, ut, dum tyrannica rabie immemor iuramentorum apicem dominandi, cuius appetitus per acquisitionem crescit, appeteret, imperii potentia schismatica turbatione vilesceret. | Moreover, another law was issued that no one could succeed to multiple great fiefs, lest by accumulating multiple great fiefs the power of the subjects increase so much that, driven by tyrannical rage, forgetting the oaths, he who sought the peak of domination, whose appetite grows through acquisition, would corrupt the power of the empire through schismatic disturbance. |
| 493 | Erat insuper imperatorum consuetudo faciliter accusationes fractae fidei et periurii admittere, ut fidelitas, per quam solum persistit imperium, numquam negligentia parvipenderetur. | It was moreover the custom of emperors to admit easily accusations of broken faith and perjury, so that loyalty, through which alone the empire persists, would never be neglected through negligence. |
| 493 | Poena vero erat privationis fidem non servanti. | The penalty was deprivation for one who did not keep the oath. |
| 493 | Et tunc, ne invidia forte incitaret nobiles eiusdem sanguinis contra eum, cui haec ablata donarentur, ista, quae sic in commissum ceciderunt, sacri imperatores ecclesiis frequenter applicarunt. | And then, lest envy might perhaps excite the nobles of the same blood against him to whom these things were given, these, which thus fell into his hands, the sacred emperors often applied to the churches. |
| 494 | Multis similibus sacris ordinationibus circumspectissimi imperatores pro conservanda re publica et sacri imperii usi sunt, tam in ordinandis iudiciis scabinorum, qui dictatores sententiarum exsistunt et ad hoc ex popularibus cum iuramento recte secundum conscientiam et rationem iudicandi assumuntur, ne in potestate praesidentis esset ad nutum subiectos punire iuxta motum animi sui, quam etiam in cunctis aliis negotiationibus, talliis et theoloniis. | Many similar sacred ordinances were used by the most careful emperors for the conservation of the commonwealth and the sacred empire, such as in the appointment of judges, who are the dictators of sentences and are assumed for this purpose from the people with the oath rightly according to conscience and reason, lest the subjects be punished at the will of the presiding judge, as also in all other negotiations, such as in the buying and selling of goods. |
| 495 | Et cuncta tendebant ad publicam utilitatem. | And all things tended to the public good. |
| 495 | Erat tunc imperator habens publicam defendendae pacis personam, ad hoc habens de publico exercitum stipendiatum. | Then the emperor had a public person for the defense of peace, with a public army being paid. |
| 495 | Undique per principes et rectores timebatur, undique per populum defensor patriae, conservator libertatis, relevator oppressorum, rigidissimus exsecutor in rei publicae turbatores adorabatur, venerabatur et colebatur. | Everywhere he was feared by princes and rulers, everywhere by the people as the defender of the fatherland, the conservator of liberty, the reliever of the oppressed, the most rigid executor of those who disturbed the commonwealth, he was adored, revered, and worshipped. |
| 495 | Tunc recte in eum delinquens maiestatem summam offendit, et hoc crimen maximum erat, qui in patriae et omnium patrem peccavit. | Then he who committed a crime against him greatly offended the highest majesty, and this crime was the greatest, who in the fatherland and for all fathers sinned. |
| 495 | Quod si cuncta illa dignissima relatui inscriberem, prolixior proposito fierem. | If I were to relate all these things worthy of mention, I would make the discourse too long. |
| 496 | Capitulum XXIX. | Chapter XXIX. |
| 496 | Ex hiis tamen respice, quantum abscessit hodierni regiminis status, ubi paene nulla horum in usu habentur. | Nevertheless, consider how much the status of the present regime has departed from this, where almost none of these are in use. |
| 496 | Periit omnis cura rei publicae. | All care for the commonwealth has perished. |
| 496 | Laxato freno transilit quisque leges impune. | Anyone transgresses the laws unpunished. |
| 496 | Et ubi quondam veneratio cum timore et tremore, nunc despectus vel contemptus. | And where once veneration was with fear and trembling, now it is despised or contemptuously disregarded. |
| 496 | Et leges omnes de aranearum telis connexae sunt. | And all the laws are connected with the threads of spiders. |
| 496 | Minutissimae vix locustae teneri in ipsis possunt. | The minutest locusts can barely be held in them. |
| 496 | Non sicut quondam, quando in limitibus concupiscentiae, ut aprorum fortissima retia continue tensa, importunos transgressores innectebant. | Not like before, when in the boundaries of desire, like the strongest nets of lions, they continuously entangled the importunate transgressors. |
| 496 | Iam privato commodo invigilant cuncti. | Now everyone watches over private profit. |
| 496 | Nulla de proximo et de futuro cura per incuriam imperatorum, qui pietate tantum putantes reficere posse et reformare aberrata censura omnis cessavit. | There is no care for the present or the future by the emperors, who think that they can refill and reform aberrant judgment only with piety. |
| 496 | Non puniuntur rebelles. | Rebels are not punished. |
| 496 | Et facti sunt ex tyrannica dominatione principes multi et potentes imperio decrescente. | And many princes and powerful ones have become from the tyrannical domination of the empire. |
| 497 | Temporalia ecclesiarum, quid prosunt rei publicae? | What do temporal possessions of the churches profit the commonwealth? |
| 497 | Quid imperio? | What does the empire? |
| 497 | Quid subditis? | What do the subjects? |
| 497 | Immo parum aut nihil. | Indeed little or nothing. |
| 497 | Mandabatur Ottoni 63 di. | Mandate was given to Otto 63 days. |
| 497 | In synodo absque pecunia investituras episcoporum dare. | In the synod, investments of bishops were to be given without money. |
| 497 | An ab ipso imperatore sola investitura sublata sit per papam, vidimus, quoniam non solum pura absque acceptione pecuniae attracta est investitura per Romanum pontificem, sed etiam tantum de pecunia, ut per Alemanniam omnes se non gravatos tantum, sed destructos conquerantur. | We have seen that the investment alone was drawn away by the pope from the emperor, since not only was the investment attracted by the Roman pontiff without the acceptance of money, but also only concerning money, so that through Germany all were compelled not only not to be burdened, but to be destroyed. |
| 497 | Rabidus appetitus ad ipsa terrena ecclesiis annexa dominia episcopis ambitiosis hodie inest, ut ea videamus expresse agere, dum promoti sunt, quae ante ambiebant. | The ravenous desire for the temporal possessions of the ambitious bishops is today present for the churches, so that we may see it clearly acting, when they were promoted, which before were striving. |
| 497 | De temporalibus omnis cura, de spiritualibus nulla. | All care is for the temporal, none for the spiritual. |
| 497 | Non fuit ista imperatorum intentio. | This was not the intention of the emperors. |
| 497 | Non volebant spiritualia a temporalibus absorberi, quae pro eorum augmento ecclesiis dedere. | They did not want the spiritual to be absorbed by the temporal, which they gave to the churches for their increase. |
| 498 | Et haec omnia, proh dolor, ex perverso ordine eveniunt. | And all these things, alas, come about in a perverse order. |
| 498 | Et quia nulli canones servantur, nulla coerctio, nulla disciplina nec punitio. | And because no canons are observed, no coercion, no discipline nor punishment. |
| 498 | Praeterea illud temporalis dominii ecclesiasticorum regimen multum rei publicae et subiectis obest. | Moreover, the regime of the temporal possessions of the ecclesiastical lords greatly obstructs the commonwealth and the subjects. |
| 498 | Dum vacat ecclesia, semper in periculo schismatis exsistunt, aut quod exactionari plus debeant aliis sub saecularibus exsistentes, quoniam si per electionem providendum est, ambitio procurat divisionem votorum, si per curiam, facilius persuadetur pro plus offerenti. | While the church is vacant, they always exist in danger of schism, or they demand more from others who exist under secular rule, since if election is to be provided, ambition causes division of votes, if by a court, it is more easily persuaded for the one who offers more. |
| 499 | Et omnia illa gravamina adveniunt pauperibus subditis. | And all these burdens come upon the poor subjects. |
| 499 | Curia attrahit quidquid pingue est. | The court attracts whatever is fat. |
| 499 | Et id, quod imperium contulit et pro dei cultu et bono publico ordinavit sanctissime, avaritia et cupiditate exorta palleatis rationibus et novis adinventionibus totaliter pervertitur, et imperiale efficitur papale et spirituale temporale. | And what the empire gave and ordered most holy for the worship of God and the common good, avarice and cupidity, stirred up by perverse reasons and new inventions, is totally perverted and made imperial and spiritual temporal. |
| 500 | Capitulum XXX. | Chapter XXX. |
| 500 | Est insuper alia imperii destructio, quoniam, cum imperator solum administrator in utilitatem rei publicae exsistat, saepe per pacta electorum sua quaerentium intrat regimen et occupata contra ius imperialia ob iusiurandum repetere non audet, theolonia gravantia rem publicam deponere ac alias utiles ordinationes facere, et per antecessores inconsulte absque omnium conventu amoris inordinati aut affectionis vel sanguinis tam in praeiudicium imperii donata vel impignorata revocare inhibetur. | Moreover, another destruction of the empire is that, since the emperor exists only as an administrator for the benefit of the commonwealth, he often enters into the government through pacts of the elected, his rights being sought, and he does not dare to reclaim them by the oath of office, even though he is burdened with the tyranny of the theologians, which oppresses the commonwealth and makes other useful ordinances, and through his predecessors the inconsiderate revocation of donations or pledges given or mortgaged out of affection or kinship, who ruled the empire, is hindered. |
| 500 | Et sic fit, ut, dum electores sua quaerunt, ita sua credita potestate abutantur, quod eis concessa potestas pro bono imperii in eius destructionem convertatur. | And so it happens that, while the electors seek their own, they abuse their power, which was granted for the benefit of the empire, to its destruction. |
| 501 | Quoniam imperatores non deberent permitti ab ipsis facere alienationes praeiudiciales imperio, ipsi assistere deberent, ut semper augustus esset. | Since emperors should not be allowed by them to make prejudicial alienations of the empire, they should assist to ensure that the august one is always. |
| 501 | Sed quia eum ligant – ne ipsis donata vel obligata aliquando ficte vel per consanguineos aut parentes, qui imperio praefuerunt – tacent, dum idem facere vident imperatorem, ne se ipsos dampnent. | But because they are bound – lest they themselves be damned if they ever gave or mortgaged anything to the emperor – they are silent, when they see the same thing done by the emperor, lest they themselves be damned. |
| 502 | O caecitas maxima. | O blindness great. |
| 502 | Non credant principes de bonis imperii divites fieri et permanere posse aliquamdiu. | Let princes not believe that they can become rich with the goods of the empire and remain for a long time. |
| 502 | Curantibus enim omnibus sua augmentare, imperio ad nihil tendente, quid sequitur nisi universorum destructio? | Those who care for all things to increase their own, while the empire tends to nothing, what follows but the destruction of all? |
| 502 | Quoniam non exsistente potentia maiori conservativa et pacativa imperii, invi dia eademque semper crescente cupiditate guerras, schismata divisionesque faciet, et tunc, sicut omne regnum in se divisum, desolabitur inique collectum. | Since there is no greater power for the conservation and pacification of the empire, through wars, schisms, divisions, it will make, and then, like every kingdom divided, it will be desolated unjustly collected. |
| 503 | Decipiuntur itaque principes sub imperio, dum ob illum finem attrahunt et colligunt undique imperialia, ut potentiores et fortiores fiant, quoniam, postquam totam capitis et imperii potestatem membra laniaverint et deglutiverint, desinet hierarchicus ordo. | Thus, the leaders are deceived under imperial sway, as they attract and gather imperial resources to become more powerful and stronger, for once they have stripped the limbs of authority and power from the head and consumed them, the hierarchical order will cease. |
| 503 | Non est primus, ad quem concurratur. | There is no first person to whom they all rush. |
| 503 | Et ubi non est ordo, est confusio. | And where there is no order, there is confusion. |
| 503 | Et ubi confusio, ibi nullus tutus. | And where there is confusion, there no one is safe. |
| 503 | Et sic nobilibus inter se altercantibus ius omne in armis propriis quaerentes surgent populares, quoniam, sicut principes imperium devorant, ita populares principes. | Thus, when noblemen, quarreling among themselves and seeking all rights in their own possessions, rise up, as leaders devour the empire, so do the populace rise against the leaders. |
| 504 | Capitulum XXXI. | Chapter XXXI. |
| 504 | Insuper hodie videmus aut confusionem maximam in ordine iudiciario aut penitus nullam iustitiam. | Moreover, today we see either the greatest confusion in the judicial order or the complete absence of justice. |
| 504 | Hodie honor distinguitur a iure. | Honor is distinguished from law today. |
| 504 | Et occupare etiam maxima dominia nobiles licite se posse dicunt, ubi possessorem nihil iuris habuisse nec habere concedunt. | And even the noblest are allowed to claim the greatest domains lawfully, where the possessor has had no right and none is granted them. |
| 504 | Per vilissimum diffidationum modum honorem salvari putant, et vi post ipsam intimatam diffidationem ex quacumque conficta aut nulla causa qualitercumque rapta, palam aut occulte, licite credunt possideri, etiam si bona ecclesiae aut clericorum forent. | They think to save honor by the vilest means of intimidation, and by force after the intimidations are exhausted, openly or secretly, lawfully believe they can possess, even if these were goods of the church or clerics. |
| 504 | O praesumpta audacia contra omnes leges et iura. | O presumptuous audacity against all laws and rights! |
| 504 | O iniquissimum iudicium distinguens honestum a iusto, affirmans iniustum honeste possideri. | O most unjust judgment distinguishing the honorable from the just, affirming that the unjust can possess honorably! |
| 504 | Fuit rationabiliter sancitum omnem diffidationem supremi iudicis consensu non interveniente et inhonestam et iniustam et eos latrunculos fore, qui adversariorum bona illa via occuparent, ff. | It was reasonably established by the highest judge's consent that all forms of intimidation, involving dishonest and unjust conduct by those who seize adversaries' goods through such means, are the acts of rogues, ff. |

| 504 | Olim 1 De restitutione spoliorum, et ibi doctores. | Once upon a time, Chapter 1 On the restitution of spoils, and there its teachers. |
| 505 | Insuper manifestum est res ecclesiae non esse cuiusquam praelati vel clerici, nec delictum ipsius praelati in dampnum ecclesiae eapropter &laddredundare&radd potest. | Moreover, it is evident that the church's property belongs to no prelate or cleric, nor should the crime of the prelate harm the church itself, therefore &laddredundare&radd repetition is not permitted. |
| 505 | &laddQuomodo&radd tu nobilis credis honestam esse diffidationem, quam aut clerico aut religioso conventui seu praelato scribis? | &laddQuomodo&radd How can you, noble one, believe it honorable to resort to intimidation, whether by a cleric, religious community, or prelate? |
| 505 | Insuper, si hoc est honestum, quod sine maiori excommunicatione sive sacrilegio fieri nequit, quis adeo amens hoc concedit? | Moreover, if this is considered honorable, which cannot be done without major excommunication or sacrilege, who would so madly concede this? |
| 505 | Si clericum etiam divina lege tu laicus capere propria auctoritate aut male tractare prohiberis, quam credis virtutem tuae fabricatae diffidationis cedulae inesse, ut tunc omnia iura divina et humana cessare et mortua esse credas, quando litterulam praemittis? | If even a cleric, by divine law, you prevent as a layperson from exercising their rightful authority or mishandling, in what do you see the virtue of your contrived act of intimidation reside, that you believe all divine and human laws cease and are dead when you send a letter? |
| 505 | Sic, si ecclesiarum bona absque sacrilegio vi rapi et distrahi per laicum non possunt, quomodo credis id licitum, quod est sacrilegum? | Thus, if ecclesiastical goods cannot be seized and carried away by laypersons without sacrilege, how do you believe it lawful, which is sacrilegious? |
| 505 | Error maximus et manifestus, qui noviter in Alemanniae partibus, proh dolor, inolevit, per quem deus offenditur, pax publica et omnis status turbatur. | The greatest and manifest error, which has recently crept into parts of Alemannia, alas, sorrowing, by which God is offended, public peace and all order are disturbed. |
| 506 | Quis posset cuncta enarrare, quae nostro tempore inique introducta sunt et iniquissime defenduntur? | Who could possibly recount all that has been unjustly introduced and defended iniquitously in our time? |
| 506 | Et haec omnia ideo, quia leges et canones perdiderunt vigorem et custodes et executores et pastores nulli sunt. | And all this because laws and canons have lost their force, and there are no custodians, executors, nor shepherds. |
| 507 | Capitulum XXXII. | Chapter XXXII. |
| 507 | Per ordinem illis deformitatibus ac periculis, in quibus res publica versatur ob praemissa, providendum esset diligenter et cito, quia mortalis morbus imperium Germanicum invasit, cui, nisi subito salutari antidoto subveniatur, mors indubie sequetur. | Due to the deformities and dangers in which the state now drifts due to the aforementioned, careful and prompt provision must be made, as a mortal illness has invaded the German empire, which, unless an immediate healing remedy is applied, will surely lead to death. |
| 507 | Et quaeretur imperium in Germania, et non invenietur ibi. | And the empire in Germany will be sought but not found there. |
| 507 | Et per consequens alieni capient loca nostra, et dividemur inter nos, et sic alteri nationi subiciemur. | Consequently, our lands will be seized by foreign nations, we will be divided among ourselves, and thus subjected to another nation. |
| 507 | Non potest autem melius provideri, quam per iam tritas et expertas antiquas vias, ad quas per reformationem accedere necesse habemus. | It cannot be better provided for than by the well-trodden and well-tested ancient ways, to which through reformation we must return. |
| 508 | Quare prima radix est instituere annuos conventus generales et in hoc sacro Basiliensi concilio incipere et futuris regulam dare. | Therefore, the primary root is to establish annual general imperial councils and begin this sacred enterprise from the Basilian council, laying down future regulations. |
| 508 | Agat itaque piissimus imperator, ut diligentissimus semper fuit, ut per suam sacram iussionem omnes maiores imperii principes utriusque status concurrant. | Let the most pious emperor act as he has always been most diligent, so that all principal leaders of both estates may convene through his sacred mandate. |
| 508 | Proponat sua admiranda industria imperii flebilem et undique diminutissimum statum. | He should present his remarkable industry in depicting the lamentable and utterly diminished state of the empire. |
| 508 | Aperiat, quid in Italia, quid in Langobardia de vigentibus imperii iuribus repererit. | He should disclose what he has found regarding extant imperial laws in Italy, Lombardy, and throughout Germany. |
| 508 | Adiciat, quid in Arelatensi regno et per totam Germaniam supersit. | He should add what pertains to the kingdom of Arles and throughout all Germany. |
| 508 | Et dum florentissimi quondam et tremendae poten tiae imperii miserabilem statum aperuerit, de eo, quod proxime superveniet, nisi remedium apponatur, subiungat. | While revealing the once flourishing and formidable power of the empire's pitiable state, he should add what will follow unless a remedy is applied. |
| 508 | Remedium vero ab ipsis, qui et fidelissimi fuere et sunt et ad hoc voto et iuramento astricti, perquirat. | The remedy, however, must be sought from those who have been and remain most faithful, vowed and sworn to this task. |
| 509 | De successore ordo detur, concurrente providentia imperialis suae celsitudinis. | Regarding the successor, let imperial providence concur with his lofty dignity bequeath order. |
| 510 | Capitulum XXXIII. | Chapter XXXIII. |
| 510 | Et quia non posset tantus lapsus pristinae sanitati restitui, ordo in curando detur. | Since such a great fall from former health cannot be fully restored, the order must be entrusted to healing. |
| 510 | Primo de annuis conciliis imperialibus et iustitia servanda. | First, concerning imperial councils and justice to be upheld. |
| 510 | Reperio quidem per Constantinum magnum, ut inferius copia quaedam subiungetur, Galliae per talem conventum et iudices provisum. | Indeed, through Constantine the Great, as more will be abundantly added below, Gaul had such a council and judges provided. |
| 510 | Nam postquam imperialia iudicia ac conventus cessavere, paene omnes deformitates sunt introductae. | For when imperial judgments and councils ceased, almost all deformities have been introduced. |
| 511 | Videtur itaque ordinandum, quod duodecim aut plures sedes sparsim per provincias imperio subditas taliter ordinentur, quod quaelibet sedes ex tribus iudicibus constituatur pro triplici hominum statu, scilicet ex nobili, ecclesiastico et populari, et quod ipsi iudices de omnibus causis in eis decreto territorio exsistentibus inter quascumque personas etiam ecclesiasticas quoad temporalitatem, quae ab imperio dependet, cognoscere possint per viam appellationis a proprio ordinario vel simplicis querelae, si actor vel reus ordinarium supra se non habuerit, puta quia princeps, aut si habuerit et alteri suspectus fuerit et non alias. | It thus appears necessary to ordain that twelve or more seats be sparsely distributed throughout the provinces under imperial control, so constituted that each seat consists of three judges for the three states of humanity, namely, from the noble, ecclesiastical, and popular ranks, and these judges may discern all causes within their territory concerning temporal matters dependent on imperial authority through the means of appeal, simple complaint, or ordinary jurisdiction, if either the actor or defendant lacks a higher authority, say because of the prince's involvement, or if one has it and another suspect arises who cannot be otherwise judged. |
| 511 | Et quae per appellationem introducta fuerit, ibi ultimum finem per sententiam capiat. | What is brought forth through appeal shall ultimately be concluded by judgment. |
| 511 | Quae vero per simplicem querelam, illa per appellationem ad proximum conventum, si magna aut inter magnas fuerit, deferri poterit. | However, what arises through a simple complaint may be deferred to the next council if it is significant or among major matters. |
| 511 | Pronuntiet et citet quisque iudicum secundum condicionem disceptantium personarum, nobilis inter nobiles, ecclesiasticus inter ecclesiasticos, popularis inter populares. | Each judge should pronounce and cite according to the condition of the disputing parties, noble among nobles, ecclesiastical among ecclesiastics, popular among the populace. |
| 511 | Nulla tamen diffinitiva feratur nisi ex communi deliberatione omnium trium, qui in arduis consilium peritissimorum requirant. | No definitive decision shall be rendered except by the mutual deliberation of all three, who seek counsel from the most experienced in difficult cases. |
| 511 | Si vero unus duobus dissenserit, vincat opinio maioris numeri in iudicando. | If one dissents from two, the opinion of the majority prevails in judgment. |
| 512 | Habeant etiam ipsi iudices potestatem suam sententiam executioni demandandi per bannum et saeculare brachium, mulctas et poenas aerario publico cedentes. | Judges should also have the power to enforce their sentences through proclamation and civil authority, surrendering fines and penalties to the public treasury. |
| 513 | Debet etiam ipsis iudicibus et aliis omnibus salarium ex publico deputari, ut iurent secundum textum Legis Iuliae repetundarum, canonizatae 1 q. | Judges and all others should receive a salary from the public funds to act according to the stipulations of the Julian Law on embezzlement, canonized 1 q. |

| 514 | Et statuatur lex, quod nulli liceat sub poena furti et latrocinii violenter propria auctoritate ex quacumque causa alterius bona occupare aut sibi et suis dampna inferre per diffidationes, sed omnia fiant iudicum auctoritate, qui etiam repressalias concedere possint contra contumacem. | Therefore, a law is established that no one under penalty of theft and robbery may violently seize property by their own authority for any cause and unjustly harm another and their interests through intimidation; all must be done by judicial authority, which may also grant reprieves against contumacious individuals. |
| 514 | Qui enim propria auctoritate accipit gladium, gladio feriendus est, 23 q. | He who takes up arms by his own authority is liable under the Julian Law, 23 q. |

| 515 | Verum, si quis contra hanc legem facere praesumpserit, in quocumque iudicio, villagio vel civitate deprehendatur, poena furti et latrocinii plectetur. | However, if anyone presumes to act against this law, whether apprehended in any court, village, or town, they shall suffer the penalty for theft and robbery. |
| 515 | Alioquin, si forte iudicium, ubi deprehensus fuerit, hoc facere noluerit aut neglexerit, dum commode potuit, sint ipsorum iudicum bona eo ipso confiscata. | Otherwise, if perhaps they refuse or neglect to act when they could conveniently, their goods shall be confiscated by those same judges. |
| 516 | Similiter, si quis illos assismos acceptaverit, debet talis ut publicus hostis capi et eius bona occupari posse absque alia diffidentia, ut notat Hostiensis in Summa de treuga et pace § 3 v. | Similarly, if any accept such accomplices, they should be treated as public enemies, capable of seizing and occupying their goods without further doubt, as noted by Hostienses in Summa de treuga et pace § 3 v. |
| 516 | Sed et si. | Yet also if. |
| 517 | Verum oportet hanc legem communi consensu omnium statui et subscribi et ad provincias mitti, ut acceptetur et sigilletur et eius copia in provincia servetur et sigillata ad cancellariam imperii remittatur, ut sic omnium consensu firmetur. | But it is necessary that this law be established and signed with the common consent of all and sent to the provinces, so that it may be accepted and sealed, and a copy preserved in the province and the sealed one sent to the imperial chancery, so that thus it may be confirmed with the consent of all. |
| 517 | Oportet etiam per omnes principes in conventu exsistentes istam legem subscribi et sigillari et cum hoc aliam legem, qua caveatur, quod omnis, sive princeps vel alius, qui contra suam propriam subscriptionem propria auctoritate facit absque iudicum aut imperatoris licentia, talis in se ipsum sententiam ipso facto tulit infamiae et privatus sit omni honore, et sit in potestate imperatoris suo fisco omnia bona quae habet applicare, si princeps fuerit, si vero alius et laicus, sint eo ipso confiscata, si clericus, deponatur per synodum clericorum, et cum hoc administratione temporalium sit eo ipso privatus, et per iudices temporaneus administrator ad nutum removibilis deputetur. | It is also necessary that this law be signed and sealed by all the princes present at the assembly, and with this another law, by which it is provided that whoever, whether prince or another, acts contrary to his own signature by his own authority without the permission of judges or the emperor, such a person immediately incurs a sentence of infamy and is deprived of all honor, and the emperor shall have power to apply to his fisc all the goods he possesses, if he is a prince; if, however, he is another layman, they shall be immediately confiscated; if a cleric, he shall be deposed by a synod of clerics, and with this, he shall immediately be deprived of the administration of temporalities, and a provisional administrator shall be appointed by judges, removable at will. |
| 518 | Ista lex subscribatur cum aliis per omnes. | Let this law be signed together with others by all. |
| 518 | Et has subscriptiones servet scrinium imperiale, ut per ipsas quisque transgressor convincatur. | And let the imperial archive preserve these signatures, so that by them each transgressor may be convicted. |
| 518 | Et non poterit iustitiae rigor commode introduci, nisi hoc ordine vel consimili via facti et diffidationum communi consensu tollatur. | And justice’s rigor cannot be conveniently introduced unless this order or a similar way is established and the suspicions are removed by common consent. |
| 519 | Capitulum XXXV. | Chapter XXXV. |
| 519 | Ordinetur autem conventus annuus circa festum Pentecostes in Francfordia, qui videtur locus ex situ et aliis circumstantiis aptissimus, ad quem concurrant iudices omnes et electores imperii in propria persona absque pompa et gravibus expensis. | Let an annual assembly be arranged around the feast of Pentecost in Francfort, which seems by its location and other circumstances to be the most suitable place, to which all judges and electors of the empire shall come in person without pomp and heavy expenses. |
| 519 | Et praesideat ipse dominus imperator, si praeesse poterit per se, alioquin primus ex electoribus eius nomine. | And let the emperor himself preside, if he is able to do so in person; otherwise, the first of the electors in his name. |
| 519 | Et facta imperii ac etiam particularia, quae occurrerunt iudicibus, tractentur et reformentur reformanda. | And both imperial and also particular matters that have occurred to the judges shall be discussed and reformed as necessary. |
| 519 | Si vero ardua materia deposcit plenissimum conventum omnium principum ibi vel alibi fieri, fiat, quod plus expedit. | If, however, a difficult matter demands a full assembly of all the princes, either there or elsewhere, let it be done, which is more expedient. |
| 520 | Istud vero ordinarium concilium annuum dominorum iudicum ac electorum numquam obmittatur, in quo causae principum per communem sententiam decidantur. | But this regular annual council of the lords of judges and electors shall never be omitted, in which the causes of the princes are decided by common judgment. |
| 520 | Et quia prodest ab exemplis reformationem introducere, epistulam imperialem, et ut creditur Constantini, qui iubebat in Arelato similem conventum iudicum Galliarum fieri, submittam. | And since it is beneficial to introduce reform from examples, I shall submit the imperial letter, and as is believed, that of Constantine, who ordered a similar assembly of the judges of the Gauls to be held in Arles. |
| 520 | Vocabatur autem Arelatum urbs Constantiniana. | But Arles was called a city of Constantine. |
| 521 | Incipit autem sacra illa iussio Saluberrima, quae ad virum illustrem Agricolam Galliarum praefectum fuit directa, ubi in forma habetur: «Saluberrima magnificentiae tuae suggestione inter reliquas rei publicae utilitates evidenter instructi observanda provincialibus nostris, id est per septem provincias, mansura in aevum auctoritate decernimus, quod sperari plane ab ipsis provincialibus debuisset. | It begins with that sacred and most wholesome command, which was directed to the illustrious man Agricola, the prefect of the Gauls, in which it is phrased: “By your most wholesome suggestion, we have clearly instructed that among other public utilities, it is to be observed by our provinces, that is, through the seven provinces, to remain in perpetual authority, which we decree should have been hoped for entirely from the provinces themselves. |
| 521 | Nam cum propter privatas ac publicas necessitates de singulis civitatibus, non solum de provinciis singulis, vel honoratos confluere vel mitti legatos aut possessorum utilitas aut publicarum ratio exigat functionum, maxime opportunum et conducibile iudicamus, ut servata post hac forte de quidem annis singulis consuetudine constituto tempore in metropolitana, id est in Arelatensi urbe, incipiant septem provinciae habere concilium, in quo plane tam singulis quam omne commune consulimus. | For since because of private and public necessities, from each city, not only from each province, either honorable men may congregate or send envoys or the utility of possessors or the public reason may require functions, we judge it most suitable and beneficial that, after this, perhaps every year by custom, at a fixed time in the metropolitical, that is, in the city of Arles, the seven provinces may have a council, in which we may entirely consult both individually and collectively. |
| 521 | Primum ut optimorum conventum sub illustri praesentia praefecturae, si id tamen ratio publicae dispositionis obtulerit, saluberrima de singulis rebus possent esse consilia. | First, that the best assembly under the illustrious presence of the prefecture, if indeed the public order so requires, may have wholesome counsel on all matters. |
| 521 | Tamen, quidquid tractatum fuerit et discussis ratiociniis constitutum, nec latere potiores provincias poterit, et parem necesse est inter absentes aequitatis formam iustitiaeque servari. | Yet, whatever may be discussed and decided after deliberation, the more important provinces cannot remain in ignorance, and equality is necessary, and the form of justice must be preserved among the absent. |
| 522 | Hoc plane praeter necessitates publicas etiam humanae ipsius conversationi non parum credimus commoditati accedere, quod in Constantina urbe iubemus annis singulis esse concilium. | This, beyond public necessities, we believe to be no small advantage to human life itself, and we command that there be an assembly in the city of Constantine every year. |
| 522 | Tanta est enim loci opportunitas, tanta est copia commerciorum, tanta illic frequentia commeantium, ut, quidquid usquam nascitur, illic commodius distrahatur. | For the location offers such opportunity, such abundance of commerce, such frequent gathering of people, that whatever is born anywhere may be more conveniently drawn there. |
| 522 | Neque enim ulla provincia ita peculiari fructus sui felicitate laetatur, ut non haec propria Arelatensis soli credatur esse fecunditas. | For no province so rejoices in the special fruitfulness of its own happiness, that it is not believed that this fertility is peculiar to the soil of Arles. |
| 522 | Quidquid enim dives oriens, quidquid odoratus Arabs, quidquid delicatus Assyrius, quod Africa fertilis, quod speciosa Hispania, quod fortis Gallia potest habere praeclarum, ita illuc exuberat affatim, quasi ibi nascantur omnia, quae ubique constat esse magnifica. | For whatever the rich East, or the fragrant Arab, or the delicate Assyrian, or the fertile Africa, or the beautiful Hispania, or the brave Gaulia may have of admirable things, it so abounds there spontaneously, as if all things were born there, which are known to be magnificent everywhere. |
| 522 | Iam vero decursus Rhodani et Turreni <r>ecursus necesse est, ut vicinum faciant ac paene conterminum, vel quod iste praeterfluit vel ille quod circuit. | Indeed, the course of the Rhône and the return of the Turrinus must make them near and almost contiguous, whether this flows past or that encircles. |
| 523 | Cum ergo huic serviat civitati, quidquid habet terra praecipuum, ad hanc velo, remo, vehiculo, terra, mari, flumine deferatur, quidquid singulis nascitur. | Therefore, since this city serves, whatever the land has of chief importance, let it be carried to this place by will, oar, vehicle, land, sea, or river, whatever is born in each. |
| 523 | Quemadmodum non multum sibi Galliae nostrae praestitum credant, cum in eadem civitate praecipiamus esse conventum, in qua divino quemadmodum munere commoditatum et commerciorum opportunitas tanta praestatur. | Just as our own Gauls do not consider much to have been done for them, since we command a meeting in the same city where such a divine provision of convenience and opportunity for commerce is provided. |
| 524 | Siquidem hoc rationabili plane probatoque consilio iam et vir illustris praefectus Petronius observari debere praeceperit, quod interpellatum, vel incuria temporum vel desidia tyrannorum, reparari solita prudentiae nostrae auctoritate decernimus, Agricola parens carissime atque amantissime. | For indeed this reasonable and proved counsel has already been ordered by the illustrious prefect Petronius to be observed, which, having been neglected, either by the negligence of times or the idleness of tyrants, we decree by the authority of our own prudence to be restored, most beloved and most beloved father Agricola. |
| 525 | Unde illustris magnificentia tua et hanc praeceptionem nostram et priorem sedis suae dispositionem secuta id per septem provincias in perpetuo faciet custodiri, ut ab Idibus Augusti quibuscumque mediis diebus in Idus Septembris in Arelatensi urbe noverint honorati vel possessores iudices singularum provinciarum annis singulis concilium esse servandum, ita ut de Novempopulana et secunda Aquitanica, quae provinciae longius constitutae sunt, si eorum &laddiudices&radd occupatio certa retinuerit, sciant legatos iuxta consuetudinem esse mittendos. | Therefore, illustrious magnificence of yours, by following both this our command and the previous arrangement of your seat, you shall cause it to be perpetually kept in the seven provinces, so that from the Ides of August to the Ides of September, the honorable men or possessors, judges of each province, shall know that an assembly must be held annually in the city of Arles, so that from Novempopulana and the second Aquitanica, which provinces are more distant, if the judges’ occupation is certain, they shall know that envoys must be sent according to custom. |
| 525 | Qua provisione plurimum et provincialibus nostris gratiae nos intelligimus utilitatisque praestare et Arelatensis urbis, cuius fidei secundum testimonia atque suffragia parentis patriciique nostri multa debemus, non parum adicere nos constat ornatui. | By this provision, we understand that we bestow much grace and utility upon our provinces and add no small embellishment to the city of Arles, to whose faith, according to the testimonies and suffrages of our father and patrician, we owe much. |
| 526 | Sciat autem magnificentia tua quinis auri libris iudicem esse mulctandum, ternis honoratos vel curiales, qui ad constitutum locum intra diffinitum tempus venire distulerint. | Let your magnificence know that a judge is to be fined five pounds of gold, and honorable men or curials three pounds, who have delayed coming to the designated place within the defined time. |
| 526 | » Haec ibi. | » These are the words. |
| 527 | Ecce ad suggestionem Agricolae reformatum concilium, quod quondam annue celebrabatur, quia multum provinciis profuit. | Behold, the reformed council, suggested by Agricola, which was once celebrated annually, because it greatly benefited the provinces. |
| 527 | Notanda est etiam situatio Arelatensis civitatis, quae in Galliis tunc caput exstitit et ad nostrum imperium spectat, licet parum recognoscat. | The location of the city of Arles should also be noted, which was then the head of the Gauls and faces our empire, although it is little recognized. |
| 527 | Est similiter considerandum, quod non solum iudices, sed etiam de singulis civitatibus honoratos per se vel legatos concurrere oportebat. | It is also to be considered that not only judges, but also honorable men from each city, either in person or by envoys, were required to congregate. |
| 527 | Et similiter est considerandum, quod per mensem integrum durabat et sub poena magna stricti tenebantur venire. | And similarly, it is to be considered that it lasted for an entire month and those present were strictly bound by a heavy penalty. |
| 528 | Ad instar huius in Francfordia, quae ob mercium confluentiam et loci situm Arelato recte comparatur, statuatur concilium annuum ad minus per mensem celebrari aut Maium aut Septembrem, et cum praefatis supra de qualibet civitate et metropoli ac oppidis magnis imperialibus ad minus unus concurrat. | In imitation of this, in Francfort, which, because of the confluence of goods and its location, rightly compares to Arles, let an annual assembly be established to be held at least for a month, either in May or September, and with those mentioned above, at least one from each city and metropolis and great imperial towns shall concur. |
| 529 | Adducant etiam principes electores secum, quos voluerint, consiliarios et nobiles, et omnes astringantur iuramento secundum rectum rationis iudicium pro bono publico consilia impertiri. | Let the electors also bring with them the counselors and nobles they wish, and all shall be bound by oath according to the right judgment of reason to impart counsel for the public good. |
| 530 | Examinentur ibi provincialium consuetudines et redigantur, quantum fieri potest, ad communes observantias, et maxime captiosae formae omnino undique tollantur, quoniam saepe simplices pauperes iniustissime per cavillationes causidicorum extra formam ducuntur et a tota causa cadunt, quoniam, qui cadit a syllaba, cadit a causa, ut saepe vidi per Treverensem dioecesim accidere. | Let the customs of the provinces be examined there and, as far as possible, reduced to common observances, and especially let all deceptive forms be entirely removed from everywhere, for often simple poor people are most unjustly led out of form by the cavillations of lawyers and fall entirely from their cause, for he who falls from a syllable falls from the cause, as I have often seen happen in the Treveran diocese. |
| 531 | Deinde tollantur pessimae consuetudines, quae admittunt iuramentum contra quoscumque et cuiuscumque numeri testes. | Then let the worst customs be abolished, those which permit an oath against whomever and however many witnesses. |
| 531 | Et sunt tales pessimae observantiae multae per Germaniam contra iustitiam veram ac etiam peccata nutrientes, quae particulariter enumerare nemo sciret. | And there are many such extremely bad practices throughout Germany against true justice, even fostering sins, which no one could enumerate in detail. |
| 531 | Unde propter hoc concurrere debent provinciarum iudices et in scriptis consuetudines suarum provinciarum redigere et porrigere in concilio, ut examinentur. | Therefore, the provincial judges ought to meet for this purpose and to record the customs of their provinces in writing and submit them to the council for examination. |
| 531 | Et sic de aliis defectibus. | And so with other defects. |
| 532 | Capitulum XXXVI. | Chapter XXXVI. |
| 532 | Est denique maxima diligentia facienda in isto sacro Basiliensi concilio imperiali, ut electoribus sacri imperii detur strictissima forma, quam transgredi nullo modo liceat. | Finally, the greatest diligence must be exercised in this sacred imperial council of Basel, so that the electors of the Holy Roman Empire are given the strictest form, which they may in no way transgress. |
| 532 | In qua ante omnia astringantur iuramentis nulla practica, nullo pretio aut ob quodcumque particulare commodum, sed pure et simpliciter pro bono publico et conservatione sacri imperii et eius honore secundum deum et conscientiam eligere. | In which, above all, they are to be bound by oaths to choose purely and simply for the public good and the preservation and honor of the Holy Roman Empire, according to God and conscience, without any practical considerations, price, or any particular advantage. |
| 532 | Et si umquam reperiatur quis contrarium facere, quod tunc perpetuae infamiae ac crimine laesae maiestatis et eius poenis subiaceat. | And if anyone is ever found to do otherwise, let him be subject to perpetual infamy and the crime of lese majesty and its penalties. |
| 533 | Valde enim necessarium est ad puritatem electionis quibuscumque maximis poenis electores constringi propter practicas absurdissimas et inhonestissimas, quas legi praeterito tempore intervenisse. | For it is extremely necessary that electors be bound by the greatest penalties to ensure purity of election, because of the utterly absurd and dishonorable practices which have intervened in the past. |
| 533 | Dum ipsi sua quaererent per multos stringendi eligendum illicitos modos, res publica penitus est neglecta. | While they sought their own interests through many illicit methods of influencing the election, the republic was utterly neglected. |
| 533 | Et quia certi electores occupare dicuntur certa oppida et castra imperii, ac etiam propter theolonia et alia particularia huiusmodi, turpiter foedatae electiones per iniustas pactiones fieri dicuntur. | And because certain electors are said to occupy certain towns and castles of the empire, and also because of tolls and other such particulars, elections are said to be shamefully tainted by unjust agreements. |
| 534 | Ante omnia ista differentia, quae dat perdendi occupata aliquamdiu electoribus timorem et eapropter ita practicandi, in generali conventu pure discuti et honeste consolidari deberet, ut sic quisque ex electoribus in libertatem purae electionis constitueretur. | Above all, this difference, which gives electors the fear of losing what they have occupied for some time and therefore of acting in this way, ought to be purely discussed and honestly resolved in a general assembly, so that each elector may be established in the freedom of a pure election. |
| 534 | Et quoniam ille &laddest praeficiendus&radd imperio, qui communi omnium electorum iudicio melior videtur, subiungam nunc quandam regulam, quae in hoc multum proderit et similiter in concilio seu conventu, ubi elici debet intentio communis ex omnium votis. | And since that person is to be preferred to the empire who seems better by the common judgment of all the electors, I shall now add a certain rule which will be of great help in this matter and similarly in the council or assembly where the common intention must be elicited from the votes of all. |
| 534 | Sequitur ergo regula talis. | Therefore, such a rule follows. |
| 535 | Capitulum XXXVII. | Chapter XXXVII. |
| 535 | Sacri imperii electores, dum ad electionem procedere volunt futuri imperatoris, die statuto cum omni humilitate et devotione maxima ad divina conveniant spoliantes se omni peccato, ut in medio eorum sit Christus dominus et invocata gratia sancti spiritus. | The electors of the Holy Roman Empire, when they wish to proceed to the election of the future emperor, shall assemble on the appointed day with all humility and the greatest devotion to divine things, stripping themselves of all sin, so that Christ the Lord may be in their midst, and invoking the grace of the Holy Spirit. |
| 535 | Post introductionem devotam agendae rei tractent de pluribus, qui ad imperium dispositione extrinseca et intrinseca tantae maiestatis digni esse possint. | After a devout introduction to the matter at hand, they shall discuss the many who, by external and internal disposition, may be worthy of such majesty of the empire. |
| 535 | Et ad hoc, ut absque omni timore, liberrime et secretissime ipsa electio celebretur, praestitis iuramentis supra altare domini de eligendo iusto liberae conscientiae iudicio meliorem faciant per unum notarium nomina omnium, de quibus tractarunt, in cedulas praecise aequales redigi, et semper unum nomen in una cedula tantum, et in fine illius nominis distincte signetur numerus per 1, 2, 3, quousque perveniatur ad numerum personarum, de quibus in tractatu mentio facta fuit, quod digni reputarentur. | And to this end, so that the election itself may be celebrated without any fear, freely and secretly, having sworn oaths upon the altar of the Lord to choose the better one by the judgment of a free conscience, let them cause the names of all those about whom they have deliberated to be written on precisely equal slips of paper by one notary, and always only one name on one slip, and at the end of that name let the number be distinctly marked 1, 2, 3, until the number of persons is reached, of whom mention was made in the discussion, who were considered worthy. |
| 536 | Puta sunt decem comperti per Alemanniam, qui digni visi sunt, inter quos communi iudicio dignior eligi debet. | Suppose ten have been found throughout Germany who have seemed worthy, among whom the worthiest should be chosen by common judgment. |
| 536 | Ponatur itaque in una cedula nomen unius tantum, et sub illo nomine vel in eius latere numerus ab uno usque decem, et dentur cuilibet electori decem cedulae decem nominum. | Therefore, let the name of only one be placed on one slip, and under that name or on its side the number from one to ten, and let ten slips of ten names be given to each elector. |
| 536 | Acceptis itaque cedulis per electores trahat quisque ad partem solus et secrete cum secretario, si litteras ignorat, et positis ante se omnibus decem cedulis legat cuiuslibet nomen. | And having received the slips, each elector shall withdraw to a private place alone and secretly with a secretary, if he is ignorant of letters, and having placed all ten slips before him, he shall read the name of each. |
| 537 | Et tunc in dei nomine secundum suam conscientiam ponderet, quis inter illos omnes minus idoneus exsistat, et signet cum puncto incausti supra primum numerum simplicem longum punctum et post hoc iudicet, quis post illum minus idoneus, et signet secundum numerum cum puncto longo simplici et sic continue, quousque veniet ad optimum suo iudicio, et ibi signabit decimum numerum aut illum numerum, qui numero personarum correspondebit. | And then, in God's name, according to his conscience, he shall weigh which among them all is the least suitable, and shall mark the first simple number with a long mark of ink, and after this he shall judge who is less suitable after him, and shall mark the second number with a long simple mark, and so on, until he comes to the best in his judgment, and there he shall mark the tenth number or that number which corresponds to the number of persons. |
| 538 | Et est bonum, quod de eodem incausto et per aequales pennas et aequalia simplicia longa aut brevia puncta, secundum quod concordabunt, signent, ne cuiusquam signatura prae ceteris notari possit ad hoc, ut libertas maior in electoribus et pax inter omnes conservetur. | And it is good that they mark with the same ink and with equal pens and equal simple long or short marks, according to their agreement, lest anyone's signature may be noted above the others, so that greater freedom may be preserved among the electors and peace among all. |
| 539 | Factis itaque illis signaturis deferat in manu cedulas suas quisque ex electoribus, et proiciat unusquisque suas manu propria in saccum vacuum in medio electorum pendentem. | And when these markings have been made, let each of the electors bring forward his slips, and let each cast his own slips with his own hand into an empty sack hanging in the midst of the electors. |
| 539 | Quibus in sacco positis advocetur sacerdos, qui missam celebravit, et quidam computista habens tabulam, in qua secundum ordinem sint illa nomina, ponamus decem, eligendorum. | When these have been placed in the sack, let the priest who celebrated the mass be called, and a certain accountant having a table, on which those names are listed in order, let us say ten, to be chosen. |
| 539 | Et sedens in medio electorum sacerdos extrahat de sacco seriatim, ut manibus occurrunt, cedulas et legat nomen et numerum signatum. | And sitting in the midst of the electors, the priest shall draw from the sack in order, as they come to hand, the slips and read the name and the marked number. |
| 539 | Computista vero in latere illius nominis signet numerum, et ita fiat de omnibus. | The accountant, however, shall mark the number beside that name, and so let it be done with all. |
| 539 | Quibus expletis colligat per additionem computista numeros cuiuslibet nominis. | When these have been completed, let the accountant collect the numbers of each name by addition. |
| 539 | Et ille erit tunc imperator, qui maiorem numerum habuit. | And he shall then be emperor who has the greatest number. |
| 540 | Et secundum illam practicam infinitis fraudibus obviatur, et etiam nulla practica sinistra locum habere posset, nec poterit excogitari sanctior, iustior, honestior et liberior eligendi modus, secundum quem impossibile erit, si secundum conscientiam eligunt, quin ille praeficiatur, qui ex omnium iudicio simul collecto melior iudicatur. | And by this method, infinite frauds are avoided, and also no sinister practice could have place, nor could a more holy, just, honest, and free method of choosing be devised, according to which it will be impossible, if they choose according to conscience, that he who is judged better by the collected judgment of all should not be preferred. |
| 540 | Et non poterit alius modus securior, immo ex quo illa infallibilis sententia haberi posset, inveniri, quoniam omnes comparationes omnium personarum et omnes mixturae et syllogismi per unumquemque ex electoribus factibiles in hoc modo includuntur, quem ego non absque magno studio etiam non potui invenire. | And no safer method can be found, nay, from which that infallible judgment could be obtained, for all comparisons of all persons and all mixtures and syllogisms possible by each elector are included in this method, which I myself could not find without great effort. |
| 540 | Et credas, quod perfectior inveniri nequit. | And believe that a more perfect one cannot be found. |
| 541 | Verum, ne quis ex electoribus propria affectione decipiatur, habeatur ista cautela, quod, si est aliquis aut plures, qui ex laicis communi tractatu inter eligendos conscripti sunt, cedula proprii nominis eidem non detur, sed aliae omnes, illa dempta, ut tollatur occasio suspicionis, qua se ipsum optimum omnium aestimare posset maiorem numerum nominis sui signando. | However, lest any elector be deceived by his own affection, let this precaution be taken, that if there is someone or several who are laymen written among those to be chosen by common deliberation, let the slip of his own name not be given to him, but all the others, that one excepted, so that the occasion of suspicion may be removed, by which he might estimate himself the best of all by marking a greater number for his own name. |
| 541 | Hoc solum dempto regula praescripta in omnibus servetur, et habebitur electio, cui melior non poterit inveniri. | With only this exception, let the prescribed rule be observed in all things, and an election will be held to which a better one cannot be found. |
| 542 | Capitulum XXXVIII. | Chapter XXXVIII. |
| 542 | Hoc etiam electivo artificio multa singularia investigari possunt in conventibus principum, ex quibus magna salus rei publicae dependet. | By this elective device, many particular things can be investigated in assemblies of princes, upon which the great salvation of the republic depends. |
| 542 | Saepe enim proponitur materia, in qua commodum principum aliquorum versatur, et rei publicae utilitas in eius contrario. | For often a matter is proposed in which the advantage of some princes lies, and the utility of the republic in its contrary. |
| 542 | Et tunc non audent palam pro bono publico particulariter consulere, timentes alios alterius opinionis esse et sic non posse proficere, et sic, si non profecerint, inimicitiam contraherent illius principis, cuius commodo adversaretur votum consulentis. | And then they do not dare to openly consult for the public good in particular, fearing that others may be of a different opinion and thus unable to succeed, and thus, if they do not succeed, they would incur the enmity of that prince whose advantage the vote of the consultant would oppose. |
| 542 | &laddSaepe etiam praesidens scilicet imperator vel eius vice videtur ad unam partem quaesiti valde affectionatus. | Often also the president, namely the emperor or his deputy, seems to be greatly attached to one side of the question. |
| 542 | Tunc consiliarii timore displicentiae impediuntur in consulendi libertate. | Then the councilors are hindered in their freedom of counsel by fear of displeasure. |
| 542 | &radd | And he added |
| 543 | Unde cum omne consilium tendere debeat principaliter ad dei laudem et bonum publicum et illud semper eligibilius esse debet, quod comparatione ad aliud plus publico et communi bono convenit, tunc secundum hoc proposito aliquo dubio, super quo consultatio fieri debet, surgant e medio duo peritiores, qui se ad partem contrahant et de dubio investigent per affirmativam et negativam et consequentias ad ambas partes sequentes. | Therefore, since all counsel ought to tend principally to the praise of God and the public good, and that which by comparison with another more agrees with the public and common good ought always to be more eligible, then according to this, in some doubtful matter about which consultation must be held, let two more expert men arise from among them, who shall take opposite sides and investigate the doubt by affirmation and negation and the consequences following on both sides. |
| 544 | Puta si dubium ponitur, an expediat theolonia esse: affirmative quod sic, quia nemo ibi particulariter gravatur, sed ea, quae per mercatores solvuntur, tam per venditorem quam emptores et ipsum mercatorem simul contribuuntur, et non potest commodior congregatio pecuniarum fieri pro bono publico quam illa, et nisi essent modi leviter pecunias habendi, quae pro tuitione rei publicae sunt necessariae, periret pax. | Suppose it is doubted whether it is expedient for tolls to exist: affirmatively, yes, because no one is particularly burdened there, but what is paid by merchants, both by the seller and the buyer and the merchant himself, is contributed together, and no more convenient collection of money for the public good can be made than that, and unless there were ways of easily obtaining money, which are necessary for the protection of the state, peace would perish. |
| 544 | Igitur propter istas et alias consequentias videtur affirmative eligibilior. | Therefore, because of these and other consequences, it seems more affirmatively eligible. |
| 545 | Alius pro alia parte dicit: Haec congregatio pecuniarum est iniusta et illicita, absque culpa et causa a non subditis evacuans rem publicam nullius utilitatis, quia pax per eam minime servatur. | Another on the other part says: This collection of money is unjust and illicit, without fault and cause, emptying the state of no utility, because peace is not at all preserved by it. |
| 545 | Igitur negativa est eligibilior. | Therefore, the negative is more eligible. |
| 546 | Aperta sic materia scribatur quaestio et subscribatur affirmatio et sub illa scribatur negatio. | When the matter is thus opened, the question should be written down, the affirmation should be subscribed, and the negation should be written beneath it. |
| 546 | Sub illa scribatur medium, quod aperitur, puta si diceret unus de duobus sic: Aliqui possent dicere, quod affirmativa sit tenenda, quod theolonia sint et permaneant, aliqui, quod non, aliqui, quod sint et moderata sic, quod de esculentis et poculentis, nisi negotiationis causa deferantur, nihil solvatur, et alii, numquam ultra florenum de carrata magna vini vel centum maldris tritici, alii vero, quod solvantur theolonia ut prius, sed pecunia ad publicum aerarium pro publicis negotiis reponatur, alii, quod dividatur pecunia et medietas pro principibus et praesidibus ac iudiciis, alia ad aerarium publicum. | Beneath it, the middle position, which is revealed, should be written; for example, if one of the two were to say such things: Some might argue that the affirmative should be upheld, that the tolls should remain and persist; others, that they should not; others, that they should remain but be moderated in such a way that nothing is paid on food and drink unless they are transported for trade; others, that never more than a florin on a large cart of wine or a hundred measures of wheat should be paid; others, indeed, that the tolls should be paid as before, but the money should be placed into the public treasury for public affairs; others, that the money should be divided, with half for the princes, their representatives, and judges, and the other half for the public treasury. |
| 546 | Tales et consimiles opiniones, quae verisimiliter excogitari possent, publice per ipsos duos recitari debent, et si quis aliam addere velit dicendo, etiam posset quis sic dicere vel sic. | Such opinions, and others similarly conceived, should be publicly recited by the two individuals, and if anyone wishes to add another, they could also say such things. |
| 546 | Omnes illae sunt per ordinem scribendae sub quaestione, et fiant cedulae secundum numerum consiliariorum, et detur cuilibet una cedula. | All those opinions should be written in order under the question, and slips should be made according to the number of councilors, and each councilor should be given one slip. |
| 547 | Qua habita unusquisque in domo per iuramentum praestitum unam eligat et alias cum penna et incausto casset, lineam grossam per medium eius trahendo. | After this, each person in their home should, by the oath they have sworn, choose one and cross out the others with a pen and chalk, drawing a thick line through the middle of it. |
| 547 | Mane conveniant ad concilium, et reponat unusquisque cedulam in saccum. | They should gather in the morning for the council, and each should place his slip into the bag. |
| 547 | Quibus impositis secretarius extrahat unam post aliam, et sedeat computista, et facta ratione opinio, quae habuerit plura vota, illa electione omnium melior. | Once these are placed, the secretary should draw them out one by one, and the accountant should sit and, after the count is made, the opinion that receives the most votes should be considered the better choice by everyone. |
| 547 | Debent autem cedulae omnes esse aequales et manu unius conscriptae, ut praehabitum est. | All the slips, however, should be equal and written in the same hand, as has been established. |
| 548 | Similiter fieri deberet contendentibus pluribus magnis super eodem, ut eorum omnia nomina in cedulis similibus omnibus tradantur. | Similarly, this should be done for those contending over the same matter involving multiple parties, so that all their names are placed on similar slips. |
| 548 | Postquam casus bene apertus et intellectus fuit, et tunc per consiliarios nomina omnium per pennam cassentur illo salvo, cui adiudicandum credit suo iudicio rem de qua quaestio. | After the case has been well-explained and understood, the names of all should be struck out by the councilors, except for the one who is entrusted by his own judgment to adjudicate the matter in question. |
| 548 | Hoc modo consilia remanebunt libera et secreta, et erunt digestissima, quod singulariter nota. | In this way, the councils will remain free and secret, and they will be most orderly, as is individually noted. |
| 549 | De modo vero habilitandi ingenium ad discursum in dubiis hoc anno tractatulum collegi, quare hic non insisto. | Regarding the method of preparing the mind for discussion in doubtful matters, I have compiled a little treatise this year, and so I do not insist on it here. |
| 550 | Verum est, quod, ubi deliberatio cadit super uno tantum, affirmative vel negative simpliciter, ibi non esset incongruus modus consilii dominii Venetiarum, qui habent nodulos de panno laneo et duo vasa seu boceas ligneas ad instar sicut calices figuram habentes. | It is true that where deliberation falls on a single point, either simply affirmative or negative, the method of the council of the Venetians, who have knots of woolen cloth and two wooden vessels or boxes shaped like cups, would not be inappropriate. |
| 550 | Inferius, ubi pes est calicis, debet esse lignum vacuatum, in quam partem per canale superius cadant nodi. | At the bottom, where the foot of the cup is, there should be a hollow piece of wood into which the knots fall through a channel from above. |
| 550 | Est autem una bocea nigra, quae vocatur ‘non’, alia alba, quae vocatur ‘ita’. | There is, however, one black box called "no" and another white box called "yes." |
| 550 | Unde postquam consiliarius capit unum nodum inter pollicem et indicem et ostendit in aerem aliis, ne fraus fiat, tunc in palmam manus eam cadere sinit et claudit manum. | After a councilor takes one knot between his thumb and index finger and shows it to the others in the air, so that no fraud is committed, he then allows it to fall into the palm of his hand and closes his hand. |
| 550 | Et superius in ipsam boceam albam manum intrudit, et si est illius affirmativae opinionis, mittit cadere nodum per cannam in fundum et nihilominus extrahit manum clausam. | He also inserts his hand into the white box above, and if he holds an affirmative opinion, he lets the knot fall through the channel to the bottom, while nonetheless keeping his hand closed. |
| 550 | Et trudit etiam in aliam boceam, ne sciri possit opinio sua, in quam boceam proiecerit. | He also pushes his hand into the other box, so that his opinion cannot be known, into whichever box he casts the knot. |
| 550 | Si vero non est opinio eius de affirmativa, extrahit absque apertione manum et intrudit in aliam et ibi dimittit. | If, however, his opinion is not affirmative, he withdraws his hand without opening it and inserts it into the other box, where he releases it. |
| 550 | Hoc modo remanet votum secretum. | In this way, the vote remains secret. |
| 550 | Post hoc effunduntur nodi, quia vas inferius infra canale aperitur, et numerantur, et capitur conclusio ex numero nodorum affirmativa vel negativa secundum victoriam numeri unius boceae supra alterius boceae numerum. | After this, the knots are poured out because the lower vessel below the channel is opened, and they are counted, and a conclusion is reached based on the number of knots in the affirmative or negative box, depending on which has more. |
| 551 | De hiis artificiis quisque secundum casum et locum cogitare poterit tali semper pacto, quod libertas iudicii servetur per secretam practicam. | Each person can think about these devices according to the case and place, always in such a way that the freedom of judgment is preserved through secret practice. |

| 552 | Est consequenter ad hoc maxime studendum, quod potestas imperii resuscitetur, alioquin de omnibus ordinatis nullus sequetur effectus. | It is consequently most important to strive for this, so that the power of the empire may be revived; otherwise, no effect will follow from all the measures taken. |
| 552 | Vigor legis in coerctione est, coerctionem potentia custodit et exequitur, qua sublata – quia nitimur in vetitum et sumus ab adolescentia proni ad malum – legalis censura et per consequens pax et iustitia non diu persistent. | The strength of the law lies in coercion, which power maintains and executes, and if this is removed—since we strive for what is forbidden and are inclined to evil from youth—legal censure and consequently peace and justice will not endure long. |
| 552 | Cum ergo hoc ita sit, oportet ut per reformationem modus ad hoc detur. | Since this is the case, it is necessary that a method be given for this through reform. |
| 553 | Quondam solebant episcopi, abbates, principes et comites secundum sibi subiectam provinciam et terram annua et cottidiana servitia personalia et realia imperio facere, ex quibus quidam stipendiarii exercitui cottidiano imperiali pro defensione rei publicae tenebantur, ac etiam ipse imperator honestissimum imperialem statum gestare solebat. | Once, bishops, abbots, princes, and counts used to perform annual and daily personal and real services for the empire according to the province and land subject to them, from which some stipendiaries were bound to the daily imperial army for the defense of the republic, and even the emperor himself used to maintain the most honorable imperial status. |
| 553 | Quo quidem imperiali et rei publicae defensorio exercitu deficiente periit res publica multum. | With this imperial and defensive army of the republic failing, the republic has perished to a great extent. |
| 554 | Nam oportet quemlibet principem et quamlibet etiam universitatem et comitatum sui ipsius in resistendo latrunculis curam agere. | For every prince and every university and county must take care to resist brigands. |
| 554 | Ex quo maximae expensae exoriuntur, et subditi in hiis tempora consumentes labori libere vacare nequeunt. | From this, the greatest expenses arise, and subjects, consumed by these efforts, cannot freely devote themselves to labor. |
| 554 | Et factae sunt divisiones maximae per omnia loca imperii, et nulla penitus reperitur confidentia. | And great divisions have been made in all places of the empire, and no confidence is found anywhere. |
| 554 | Si vero foret unus omnium publicus exercitus ad pacem conservandam et ius defendendum, tot expensae inutiles ac rei publicae exinanitio non fieret. | If, however, there were one public army for all to preserve peace and defend justice, such useless expenses and depletion of the republic would not occur. |
| 555 | Perutile itaque foret huic ordinationi diligentissimam operam dare, ut per annuas contributiones moderatas secundum dominia et loca talis exercitus erigeretur, ut per ipsum iustitia et pax servaretur. | It would therefore be very useful to devote the most diligent effort to this arrangement, so that through moderate annual contributions according to the domains and places, such an army might be established to preserve justice and peace through it. |
| 555 | Posset itaque faciliter de imperialibus theoloniis et gabellis principibus pro re publica concessis competens portio pro statu imperii annue reservari et ab omnibus theoloniis in portione moderata abstrahi. | It could easily happen that a competent portion of the imperial tolls and taxes granted to princes for the republic might be reserved annually for the imperial status and moderately withdrawn from all tolls. |
| 555 | Et sic illa vectigalia ac tributa provincialia ad publicum aerarium imperiale pro exercitu praefato et statu imperiali Francfordiam reponerentur, de quibus ita recollectis in annuo concilio et ratio et ordinatio fieret in electorum ac aliorum praesentia, ut omnia iuste et prudenter disponerentur. | And thus those provincial taxes and tributes would be placed into the public imperial treasury for the aforementioned army and imperial status in Frankfurt, and when these are collected in the annual council, both the account and the arrangement would be made in the presence of the electors and others, so that all things might be justly and prudently disposed. |
| 556 | Et tunc cessarent magnae expensae, quas hodie principes coacte et inutiliter faciunt, et provinciae ditarentur et res publica et imperium exaltaretur denuo. | And then the great expenses, which princes now make under compulsion and uselessly, would cease, and the provinces would grow rich, and the republic and the empire would be exalted anew. |
| 556 | Tunc possent episcopi vacare spiritualibus et temporalia oeconomis committere, et per publicum exercitum omnis tyrannia eliminaretur ab imperio. | Then bishops could devote themselves to spiritual matters and entrust temporal affairs to stewards, and through the public army, all tyranny would be eliminated from the empire. |
| 557 | O deus, si animus omnium, qui ista laudent, ferveret in executione, tunc nostris diebus refloresceret imperium. | O God, if the spirit of all who praise these things were to burn in execution, then the empire would flourish again in our days. |
| 557 | Sed si ad ista tepidi et nostra caeca cupiditate circumventi antiquae deformatae consuetudini insistemus aliquamdiu, absque dubio de sacro imperio et bono statu rei publicae et omnium nostrum breviter actum erit. | But if we continue to insist on these things half-heartedly and, blinded by our own desires, cling to ancient, deformed customs for some time, without doubt, the sacred empire, the good state of the republic, and the well-being of us all will soon come to an end. |
| 558 | Nullus sive ecclesiasticus sive saecularis se iure poterit excusare. | No one, whether ecclesiastical or secular, can lawfully excuse himself. |
| 558 | Omnium enim bonorum temporalium regimen ad publicam commoditatem primo debet ordinari. | For the administration of all temporal goods should first be ordered for the public benefit. |
| 558 | Unde Hugo noster excellentissimus Saxo, qui de sancto Victore nominatur, in libro De sacramentis de ecclesiasticis possessionibus dicens scri bit ipsas possessiones numquam a regia potestate posse elongari. | Whence our excellent Hugo of Saxony, who is named after Saint Victor, writing in his book On the Sacraments about ecclesiastical possessions, says that these possessions can never be removed from royal power. |
| 558 | Quoniam, si ratio postulaverit et necessitas, illis ipsa potestas debeat patrocinium, et illi ipsae possessiones debeant in necessitate obsequium. | For if reason demands it and necessity requires it, the same power ought to provide protection for them, and they ought to provide service in times of need. |
| 558 | Sicut enim regalis potestas patrocinium, quod debet alteri, non potest non dare, sic ipsa possessio ab ecclesiasticis personis obtenta ob obsequium, quod regiae potestati pro patrocinio debetur, iure negare non potest. | Just as royal power cannot fail to give the protection that it owes to another, so too the possession obtained by ecclesiastical persons for the service owed to royal power cannot lawfully refuse it. |
| 558 | Haec ille. | That man has said these things. |
| 559 | Possent ad hoc dicta beati Ambrosii in epistula de tradendis basilicis et aliorum multorum adduci, quae, cum omnia praescriptis concordent, brevitatis causa supersedeo. | The words of blessed Ambrose in his letter on the surrender of basilicas and those of many others could be adduced for this purpose, which, since they all agree with the aforementioned, I omit for the sake of brevity. |
| 560 | Capitulum XL. | Chapter 40. |
| 560 | Non est dubium multa rem publicam laedentia fieri praeter superiora, quae enumerare longum esset. | There is no doubt that many things harmful to the commonwealth are done beyond what has been mentioned, which would be long to enumerate. |
| 560 | Nos scimus, quod iudiciarii longi strepitus in utroque tam saeculari quam ecclesiastico iudicio propter maximam confusionem et litium immortalitatem maxima dampna rei publicae afferunt, et maxime, quod causae in locis, ubi exortae sunt, ac in propriis provinciis non finiuntur et quod ad Romanam curiam etiam minimae causae beneficiorum ita crebriter deferuntur, ubi solum maximae tractari deberent. | We know that the lengthy and contentious proceedings in both secular and ecclesiastical courts, due to the greatest confusion and the immortality of lawsuits, bring the greatest harm to the commonwealth, and especially that cases are not settled in the places where they originated and in their own provinces, and that even the smallest cases are frequently referred to the Roman curia, where only the most important ones ought to be handled. |
| 560 | Sic enim tamen propter gratias exspectativas aut usurpatas collationes beneficiorum aut propter lites omnis sudor etiam parentum per filios ad curiam defertur, et nihil reportatur nisi quod prius in provincia habebatur, puta beneficiolum forte a propriis parentibus dotatum. | For in this way, due to expected or usurped favors or collations of benefices, or due to lawsuits, all the toil of parents is carried to the curia by their sons, and nothing is brought back except what was previously had in the province, such as a small benefice perhaps endowed by their own parents. |
| 560 | Et quia passim promotiones ad fortunam in curia fiunt, illuc confluunt omnes a teneris annis ibi degentes et exspectantes ditari, et postponunt studia ac religionum exercitia. | And because promotions to wealth are made in the curia, all those who dwell there from a young age and expect to be enriched flock to it, and they postpone their studies and the exercises of religion. |
| 560 | Deferunt aurum et argentum, reportant cartas. | They bring gold and silver, and they bring back documents. |
| 560 | Et quia canones sanctorum patrum non ita ordinarunt ac etiam, quoniam experientia docuit, quantum mali rei publicae ex hoc advenit, modis omnibus reformanda haec sunt. | And because the canons of the holy fathers did not ordain it thus, and also because experience has taught how much evil comes to the commonwealth from this, these things must be reformed in every way. |
| 561 | Non moveat quemquam commune dictum, quod saecularis potentia de hac ecclesiastica ordinatione ita introducta ex auctoritate Romani pontificis, sive in collationibus beneficiorum sive gratiis ac litibus, se impedire non habeat. | Let no one be moved by the common saying that secular power cannot hinder itself in this ecclesiastical ordination, introduced by the authority of the Roman pontiff, whether in the collation of benefices or in favors and lawsuits. |
| 561 | Si de ecclesiasticis constitutionibus ad augmentum divini cultus et pro libertate deo servientium institutis nihil immutare habeat laicalis potestas, habet tamen nihilominus providere rei publicae illis praefatis semper salvis. | If lay power has nothing to change in ecclesiastical constitutions instituted for the increase of divine worship and for the liberty of those serving God, it still has to provide for the commonwealth, always preserving the aforementioned. |
| 562 | Non deceret quemquam dicere sanctissimos imperatores, qui pro bono rei publicae in electionibus episcoporum et collationibus beneficiorum et observantia religionum multas sacras constitutiones ediderunt, errasse aut ita statuere non potuisse, sicut legitur 63 di. | It would not be fitting for anyone to say that the most holy emperors, who for the good of the commonwealth issued many sacred constitutions in the elections of bishops and the collation of benefices and the observance of religions, erred or could not have made such decrees, as is read in 63. |
| 562 | Nos sanctorum, qui est textus Caroli et Ludovici regum. | We follow the saints, which is the text of kings Charles and Louis. |
| 562 | Immo legimus Romanos pontifices eosdem rogasse, ut constitutiones pro cultu divino, pro bono publico etiam contra peccatores de clero ederent. | Indeed, we read that the Roman pontiffs asked them to issue constitutions for divine worship, for the public good, and even against sinful clergy. |
| 562 | Et si forte diceretur, robur omnium illarum constitutionum ab approbatione apostolicae aut synodicae auctoritatis dependebat, nolo in hoc insistere, licet 86 capitula regularum ecclesiasticarum antiquorum imperatorum legerim et collegerim, quae hic inserere supervacuum foret, et multa alia Caroli Magni et suorum successorum, in quibus etiam de ipso Romano pontifice ac aliis omnibus patriarchis dispositiones, quid de consecrandis episcopis et aliis capere debeant, inveniantur, et tamen numquam repperi aut papam rogatum, ut approbaret, vel etiam eapropter, quia approbatio ipsius intervenit, ligasse legitur. | And if it were said that the strength of all those constitutions depends on the approval of apostolic or synodal authority, I do not wish to insist on this, although I have read and collected 86 chapters of the ecclesiastical rules of the ancient emperors, which it would be superfluous to insert here, and many others of Charlemagne and his successors, in which dispositions are also found regarding the Roman pontiff and all other patriarchs, what they ought to take regarding the consecration of bishops and others, and yet I have never found that the pope was asked to approve, or that he was bound by his approval. |
| 562 | Bene, ut superius quodam loco habetur, aliquos Romanos pontifices fateri se illas ordinationes venerari et recipere. | Well, as is stated in a certain place above, some Roman pontiffs confess that they venerate and receive those ordinations. |
| 563 | Unde posito hoc ita esse, quod illae imperiales ordinationes in ecclesiasticis dispositionibus non habeant plus firmitatis, nisi in quantum prius in canonibus illae ordinationes reperiebantur aut in quantum per synodos approbentur et recipiantur, sicut hoc verum esse probatur ex communi vulgarissimo dicto, quod leges non dedignantur sacros canones imitari, et in contradictione seu concursu legis et canonis in ecclesiasticis absque dubio canon praefertur, tamen ad haec reformatio, quae fieri postulatur, si se ex legalibus antiquis sanctis statutis ecclesiasticis iuvaret, absque dubio potestate et auctoritate non careret. | Whence, assuming that those imperial ordinations in ecclesiastical dispositions do not have more firmness unless they were previously found in the canons or unless they are approved and received through synods, as is proven to be true from the common and most widespread saying that laws do not disdain to imitate sacred canons, and in the contradiction or conflict of law and canon in ecclesiastical matters, the canon is undoubtedly preferred, nevertheless, for this reform that is required, if it were to be aided by ancient, holy, and legal ecclesiastical statutes, it would not lack power and authority. |
| 563 | Illas enim constitutiones nemo dubitat canonicis statutis optime convenire et in nullo contradicere. | For no one doubts that those constitutions agree perfectly with canonical statutes and contradict them in nothing. |
| 564 | Et, ut uno verbo omnia concludam, si piissimus imperator cum toto sibi subiecto concilio, necessitates rei publicae considerans ac diminutionem divini cultus et morum deformitatem in omni statu cum causis et occasionibus ponderans, repeteret sacros canones antiquos ac sanctissimas priscorum observantias, et quidquid illis obviaret, sive privilegia, sive exemptiones, sive introductiones novae in collationibus beneficiorum aut litibus, una cum toto suo concilio decerneret tollendum esse et canonibus sanctis strictissime oboediendum, rogo quis Christianus dicere possit ibi aliquid praeter potestatem et auctoritatem attemptatum, quando pro custodia antiquorum canonum et legalium sacrarum sanctionum, pro augmento divini cultus, pro bono rei publicae illa fierent? | And, to conclude all things in one word, if the most pious emperor, with his entire subject council, considering the needs of the commonwealth and the diminution of divine worship and the deformity of morals in every state, weighing the causes and occasions, were to repeat the sacred canons of the ancients and the most holy observances of the primitives, and were to decree, together with his entire council, that whatever opposes them, whether privileges or exemptions or new introductions in the collation of benefices or lawsuits, ought to be abolished and that the holy canons ought to be strictly obeyed, I ask which Christian could say that anything there was attempted beyond power and authority, when it is done for the preservation of ancient canons and sacred legal sanctions, for the increase of divine worship, and for the good of the commonwealth? |
| 565 | Non retrahat te, imperatorem prudentissimum, cuiuscumque persuasio ab hac sancta tua intentione. | Let no one's persuasion, whoever it may be, deter you, most prudent emperor, from this holy intention of yours. |
| 565 | Multi quidem fingunt sub specie bonae oboedientiae rationes coloratas ad defendendum vias malas et ad excusandum excusationes in peccatis. | Many indeed feign colored reasons under the guise of good obedience to defend evil ways and to excuse excuses in sins. |
| 565 | Quaeratur solus Christus, qui est via, veritas et vita, per vias patrum nostrorum, et tollantur viae malae ex cupiditate, ambitione et avaritia introductae, ut sic reviviscant canones, sine quibus pax ecclesiae servari nequit nec religio augmentari. | Let Christ alone be sought, who is the way, the truth, and the life, through the ways of our fathers, and let the evil ways introduced by cupidity, ambition, and avarice be removed, so that the canons may thus revive, without which the peace of the church cannot be preserved nor religion increased. |
| 566 | Multa quidem alia regibus incumbunt, maxime adulteria, furta, parricidia, periuria, rapinas et consimilia peccata magna cohibere et de patria expellere, ut dicit sanctus Cyprianus, et habetur 23 q. | Many other things indeed are incumbent upon kings, especially to restrain adulteries, thefts, parricides, perjuries, rapines, and similar great sins, and to expel them from the homeland, as Saint Cyprian says, and as is found in 23. |
| 566 | 5 Rex debet cum similibus, insuper deceptiones, quae per contractus ac pravitates fiunt usurarias, per ludos taxillorum, per monopolia et huiusmodi, eradicare ac festa divina coli facere, tollere exorbitantias, quae aut in expensis nuptiarum ac mortuariorum ac pretiosarum vestium et similibus fieri solent, et breviter, cuncta ad bonum publicum redigere. | The king ought to eradicate, along with similar things, deceptions that are made through contracts and usurious pacts, through games of chance, through monopolies, and the like, and to have divine festivals celebrated, to remove excesses that are usually made in expenses of weddings and funerals and precious clothing and the like, and briefly, to reduce all things to the public good. |
| 567 | Capitulum XLI. | Chapter 41. |
| 567 | Superiora docuere veram concordantem catholicae ecclesiae harmoniam in recta ordinata praesidentia, quae ex communi consensu et electione exoritur, et libera subiectione omnium aut partis maioris consistere, ac quod canones et leges tam divinae quam communi omnium consensu humaniter rationabiliter dictatae ut aequissimum medium de hac vita transitoria ad caelestem patriam viam ostendunt. | The aforementioned things have taught the true and harmonious concord of the Catholic Church in the rightly ordered presidency, which arises from common consensus and election, and consists in the free subjection of all or the greater part, and that the canons and laws, both divine and human, dictated by common consensus and rational reasoning, show the most equitable medium from this transitory life to the heavenly homeland. |
| 568 | Verum quia opera invidiosi et a principio mendosi diaboli inter sacerdotium et imperium saepe schismata suscitantur, aut ex disceptatione super maioritate in potentatu aut timore perditionis temporalium vel huiusmodi, et illa tempestate fervente, ut satis omnibus ex evangelio dissipationem regni divisione coepta imminere constat, nec iura, nec leges, nec ordinis ecclesiastici censuram persistere posse, erit eapropter omnium orthodoxorum primum et maximum studium illaesam utriusque potentatus hierarchiam concordi vinculo alterutrum diu conservare. | But because the works of the envious and mendacious devil often stir up schisms between the priesthood and the empire, either from disputation over superiority in power or from fear of temporal perdition or the like, and in that tempestuous time, as is evident to all from the Gospel, the division of the kingdom having begun, dissolution is imminent, and neither laws nor the censure of the ecclesiastical order can persist, it will therefore be the first and greatest study of all orthodox people to preserve the hierarchy of both powers unharmed, bound together in a concordant bond. |
| 569 | Cogitet itaque, dum haec instinctu turbatoris pacis mentibus suggeruntur, ipse primus omnium, Romanus pontifex, Christi ministrum ex humiliatione exaltari, quodque supremus aliorum ministerialem curam habet, non dominationis imperium, ac utrasque a deo esse potestates ac nostro gratiae tempore vere distinctas, ut Nicolaus, maximus Romanorum pontificum, asserit 96 di. | Let him therefore consider, while these suggestions are being made to minds by the instigator of discord, that the Roman pontiff, the first of all, is exalted as a minister of Christ through humiliation, and that the highest minister has a care of service, not a dominion of power, and that both powers are from God and, in our gracious time, are truly distinct, as Nicholas, the greatest of the Roman pontiffs, asserts on the 96th day. |
| 569 | Cum ad verum, et idem 97 di. | When it comes to the truth, and on the same 97th day. |
| 569 | Ecclesiae meae confirmatur. | My Church is confirmed. |
| 570 | Consideret, ubinam potentatus Romani pontificis tantum confirmationis in extollentia ac praeceptiva subditorum oboedientia habeat sicut imperialis, ad Romanos 13. | Let him consider where the power of the Roman pontiff has such confirmation in exaltation and in the obedient submission of subjects as the imperial power has, according to Romans 13. |
| 570 | Dico de Romano pontifice, non de ipso sacro sacerdotio. | I speak of the Roman pontiff, not of the sacred priesthood itself. |
| 570 | Etiam textus Celebritatem De consecratione di. | Even the text of the Celebration on the day of Consecration says this. |
| 570 | 4 ac prima collatio in Authentica Quomodo oportet episcopis in principio et consimilia multa ad minus distinctionem independentem et, quod desursum utraque potestas descendat, probari videtur. | The fourth and first collation in the Authentic How Bishops Ought to, and many similar things, seem to prove that both powers descend from above, to a lesser independent distinction. |
| 570 | Et illa fuit omnium antiquorum opinio vera, etsi dubia noviter exorta sunt ob sinistrum multorum complacendi studium, repetantur vetera. | And that was the true opinion of all the ancients, although new doubts have arisen due to the wrong zeal of many for flattery; let the old opinions be repeated. |
| 571 | Immo si gladii utriusque potestatem papa haberet, non foret adhuc illorum intentio vere probata imperatorem ab eo dependenter gladii usum habere. | Indeed, if the pope had the power of both swords, their intention would not yet be truly proved that the emperor has the use of the sword dependent on him. |
| 571 | Nullus enim negat reges mundi diversos et varios et infideles fuisse, quorum regalis potentatus absque hoc, quod superiorem recognosceret, a deo dependebat. | For no one denies that there have been various, different, and infidel kings of the world, whose royal power depended on God without their recognizing a superior. |
| 571 | A quo, rogo, dependebat imperium Paulo appellante ad caesarem aut Chri sto ipsum approbante, dum iussit ea dare caesari, quae eius erant? | From whom, I ask, did the empire depend when Paul appealed to Caesar or when Christ himself approved, commanding that what was Caesar's be given to Caesar? |
| 571 | Non potest etiam papa in hoc se primum arguere, etiam si gladii potestatem haberet, tamquam ab eo dependeat omnis gladii potestas, dum recte praedicta ac alia infinita, quae a nostris maioribus nobis relicta sunt, ad mentem revocat. | The pope cannot even argue that he is the first in this, even if he had the power of the sword, as if all power of the sword depended on him, when he recalls the things rightly predicted and many other infinite things that have been left to us by our elders. |
| 572 | Nec exaltet papam imperialis spontanea propter Christum humilitatis reverentia, quia eum nominat et honorat ut patrem, C. | Nor does the imperial humility exalt the pope spontaneously because of Christ, for he calls him and honors him as a father. |
| 572 | De summa trinitate et fide catholica lex finalis, aut quod passus sit aliquamdiu se in secunda persona nominari a papa iuxta c. | The final law on the supreme Trinity and Catholic faith, or that he suffered for some time to be named in the second person by the pope according to canon. |
| 572 | Quam gravi De crimine falsi. | With what great crime of falsehood. |
| 572 | Sed potius advertat, quod humiles imperatores catholici Romanum pontificem scripturis et operibus ut spiritualem patrem et custodem animarum venerabantur. | But rather let him advert that humble Catholic emperors revered the Roman pontiff in writings and works as a spiritual father and guardian of souls. |
| 572 | Multo etiam plures scripturae invenirentur, quomodo Romanus pontifex imperatores honorare multo ampliori gradu solitus fuerit, ut superius Agathonis papae cum suo concilio ad Constantinum epistula declarat, ubi dicitur: «Omnes enim exigui ecclesiarum praesules vestri Christiani imperii famuli. | Many more writings could be found showing how the Roman pontiff was accustomed to honor emperors to a much greater degree, as the letter of Pope Agathon with his council to Constantine declares above, where it is said: "For all the small presbyters of the churches are servants of your Christian empire." |
| 572 | » Et ad hoc nunc sufficiat c. | And for this it is sufficient for now. |
| 572 | Victor 97 di. | Victor on the 97th day. |
| 573 | Non negat imperator iuxta c. | The emperor does not deny it according to canon. |
| 573 | Omnes principes et c. | All princes and. |
| 573 | Legebatur De maioritate et oboedientia episcopis ut patribus oboedientiam praestare debere. | It was read that in matters of greater importance and obedience, bishops ought to give obedience to their fathers. |
| 573 | Hoc ita papae ut aliis sufficiat. | This may suffice for the pope as for others. |
| 573 | Immo recordetur c. | Indeed, let him recall. |
| 573 | Omnis anima, quod est Pauli De censibus, ac etiam, quantos honores consecutus est ab imperio. | Every soul, which is what Paul says about taxes, and also how many honors he obtained from the empire. |
| 573 | Nonne, dum Constantinopolitanus patriarcha multis annis etiam ex synodali decreto se universalem et primum patriarcham ac episcopum nominaret, impetrante Bonifatio papa post mortem Mauritii imperatoris ac filiorum eius a Phoca, qui imperium occupavit, restitui ad primitivitatem, apostolica sedes eius decreto legitur ad primum gradum restituta iuxta veridicas Pauli Warnefridi Langobardorum historiographi tunc viventis scripturas? | Did not the patriarch of Constantinople, when for many years he had called himself universal and first patriarch and bishop even by synodical decree, obtain that, at the request of Pope Boniface after the death of Emperor Maurice and his sons, he was restored to his primitive rank by Phocas, who had seized the empire, and is it not read that the apostolic see was restored to its first rank according to the true writings of Paul Warnefrid, the Lombard historian, who was then living? |
| 574 | Reducat memoriae, quanta magnifica dona ac defensiones imminente turbatione ecclesiae ab imperio Romano ecclesia sit consecuta. | Let him recall to memory how many magnificent gifts and defenses the Roman empire gave to the Church when turmoil threatened it. |
| 574 | Et similiter, quomodo plus ducentis annis post primum Constantinum tempore Agathonis de labore corporis victus fuit, eo quod pristina ecclesiarum sustentatio paulatim per diversas calamitates deficiendo succubuit, ut haec in gestis sextae synodi leguntur, et quomodo ab illis calamitatibus ab imperio fuit relevatus. | And similarly, how more than 200 years after the first Constantine, in the time of Agathon, he was worn out by bodily labor, because the primitive sustenance of the churches gradually failed through various calamities, as these things are read in the acts of the sixth synod, and how he was relieved by the empire from those calamities. |
| 574 | Et sufficiat sibi eminentia, qua sol supra lunam et anima est super corpus absque hoc, quod imperium non est nisi per eum aut ab eo dependenter affirmet. | And let his eminence suffice, by which the sun is above the moon and the soul is above the body, without this: that the empire affirms that it is not except through him or dependent on him. |
