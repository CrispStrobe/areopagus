| 161 | IDIOTA DE STATICIS EXPERIMENTIS Frequentabat consortium idiotae orator ille Romanus, ut aliquando viri illius conceptus, qui sibi grati erant, audiret. | The Roman orator often attended the company of an unlearned man, so that he might sometimes hear the concepts of that man, which were pleasing to him. |
| 161 | Dumque orator laudaret stateram quasi iustitiae trutinam atque reipublicae pernecessarium instrumentum, idiota respondit: Idiota. | And while the orator was praising the balance as a kind of scale of justice and a very necessary instrument of the republic, the unlearned man responded: "Idiota." |
| 161 | Quamquam nihil in hoc mundo praecisionem attingere queat, tamen iudicium staterae verius experimur et hinc undique acceptum. | Although nothing in this world can attain precision, nevertheless we experience the judgment of the balance as truer and accepted on all sides. |
| 161 | Sed dicito quaeso, cum non sit possibile in eadem magnitudine esse idem pondus in diversis diversam habentibus originem: an ne quisquam experimentales ponderum conscripserit differentias? | But tell me, I ask, since it is not possible for the same weight to exist in different things having different origins: has no one recorded the experimental differences of weights? |
| 161 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 161 | Neque legi neque audivi. | I have neither read nor heard. |
| 161 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 161 | Utinam quisquam nobis hanc consignationem praesentaret! | I wish that someone would present us with this record! |
| 161 | supra multa volumina caripenderem. | I would gladly peruse many volumes on the subject. |
| 161 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 161 | Si tibi animus daret, ut faceres, puto per neminem melius fieret. | If you had the mind to do it, I think it would not be done better by anyone else. |
| 161 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 161 | Quisque volens faceret, cum sit facile, sed mihi deest opportunitas. | Anyone who wants to can do it, since it is easy, but I lack the opportunity. |
| 162 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 162 | Dicito utilitatem et modum! | Tell me the utility and method! |
| 162 | Videbo, si aut ego aut alius efficere queat. | I will see if either I or someone else can accomplish it. |
| 162 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 162 | Per ponderum differentiam arbitror ad rerum secreta verius pertingi et multa sciri posse verisimiliori coniectura. | I think that through the difference of weights one can arrive at the secrets of things more truly and that many things can be known by a more likely conjecture. |
| 162 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 162 | Optime dicis. | You speak excellently. |
| 162 | Nam propheta quidam ait pondus et stateram iudicium Domini illius esse, qui omnia creavit in numero, pondere et mensura et fontes aquarum libravit et molem terrae appendit, ut Sapiens scribit. | For a certain prophet says that weight and balance are the judgment of the Lord, who created all things in number, weight, and measure, and who balanced the fountains of water and weighed the mass of the earth, as the Sage writes. |
| 162 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 162 | Si igitur mensura aquae unius fontis non est eiusdem ponderis, cuius est similis mensura alterius, iudicium diversitatis naturae unius et alterius melius statera quam alio attingitur instrumento. | Therefore, if the measure of the water of one fountain is not of the same weight as the similar measure of another, the judgment of the diversity of nature of one and the other is better attained by the balance than by another instrument. |
| 162 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 162 | Bene dicis. | You speak well. |
| 162 | Admonet Vitruvius de architectura scribens locum habitationis eligendum habentem leviores et magis aëreas aquas, et graves atque terreas habentem declinandum. | Vitruvius advises, writing about architecture, that the place of habitation should be chosen having lighter and more airy waters, and that a place having heavy and earthy waters should be avoided. |
| 163 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 163 | Sicut igitur eiusdem fontis aquae videntur eiusdem ponderis et naturae, sic diversorum diversi ponderis. | Just as, therefore, the waters of the same fountain seem to be of the same weight and nature, so those of different fountains seem to be of different weights. |
| 163 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 163 | ‘Videntur’ ais, quasi aliud sit in veritate. | You say "seem," as if something else exists in truth. |
| 163 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 163 | Fateor ex tempore pondus variari, licet aliquando imperceptibiliter. | I confess that weight varies over time, although sometimes imperceptibly. |
| 163 | Nam indubie aliud est pondus aquae uno tempore, aliud alio; sic et aliud pondus aquae circa fontem, aliud in distantia a fonte. | For undoubtedly the weight of water is one thing at one time and another at another; and similarly the weight of water near a fountain is one thing and another at a distance from the fountain. |
| 163 | Sed hae differentiae vix perceptibiles saepe pro nullis habentur. | But these differences are often considered as nothing. |
| 163 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 163 | Arbitraris sic in omnibus esse, uti dixisti in aqua? | Do you think that this is the case in all things, as you said in the case of water? |
| 163 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 163 | Arbitror certe. | I certainly think so. |
| 163 | Nam nequaquam est eiusdem ponderis identitas magnitudinis quorumcumque diversorum. | For the identity of magnitude of any diverse things whatsoever is not of the same weight. |
| 163 | Unde cum aliud sit pondus sanguinis et urinae hominis sani et infirmi, iuvenis et senis, Alemanni et Afri, nonne maxime conferret medico habere has omnes differentias annotatas? | Whence, since the weight of the blood and urine of a healthy man and an infirm man, a young man and an old man, a German and an African, is different, would it not be very useful for a physician to have all these differences recorded? |
| 163 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 163 | Maxime certe, immo per pondera consignata se admirabilem constitueret. | It would certainly be most useful; indeed, by having the weights recorded, a physician would make himself admirable. |
| 163 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 163 | Arbitror enim medicum verius iudicium ex pondere urinae pariter et colore simul facere posse quam ex fallaci colore. | For I think that a physician could make a truer judgment from the weight of urine, as well as from its color, than from a fallible color. |
| 163 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 163 | Certissime. | Most certainly. |
| 164 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 164 | Sic etiam, cum herbarum radices, stipes, folia, fructus, semina et succus suum habeant pondus, si omnium herbarum pondera consignata forent cum varietate locorum, naturam omnium medicus attingeret melius in pondere et sapore quam fallaci gustu. | Similarly, since the roots, stems, leaves, fruits, seeds, and juice of herbs each have their own weight, if the weights of all herbs were recorded with the variety of places, a physician would better understand the nature of all herbs by weight and taste than by fallible taste. |
| 164 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 164 | Optime dicis. | You speak excellently. |
| 164 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 164 | Sciret deinde ex collatione ponderum herbarum ad pondus sanguinis vel urinae dosim applicationis ex concordantia et differentia medicaminis attingere, et praenostica admiranda facere; et sic staticis experimentis omne scibile praecisiori coniectura accederet. | He would then know, from the comparison of the weights of herbs to the weight of blood or urine, the dose of application of medicine from the concordance and difference, and make admirable predictions; and in this way, by experimental balances, he would approach all that can be known with a more precise conjecture. |
| 164 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 164 | Mirandum multum, quod in ponderum signatura hactenus desides fuerunt tot laboriosi investigatores. | It is greatly to be wondered at that so many laborious investigators have been so neglectful of the notation of weights up to this time. |
| 164 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 164 | Nonne putas, si aquam ex stricto foramine clepsedrae fluere in pelvim permitteres, quousque sani adolescentis pulsum centies sentires, et similiter ageres in adolescente infirmo, inter aquas illas ponderis cadere differentiam? | Do you not think that, if you allowed water to flow from a narrow opening of a clepsydra into a basin, until you felt the pulse of a healthy young man one hundred times, and similarly did with an infirm young man, a difference in weight would fall between those waters? |
| 164 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 164 | Quis dubitat? | Who doubts it? |
| 165 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 165 | Ex pondere igitur aquarum ad diversitatem pulsuum in iuvene, sene, sano et infirmo perveniretur et ita ad morbi veriorem notitiam, cum aliud pondus in una infirmitate, aliud in alia necessario eveniret. | Therefore, from the weight of waters to the diversity of pulses in a young man, an old man, a healthy man, and an infirm man, one would arrive at a truer knowledge of disease, since necessarily the weight in one infirmity is different from that in another. |
| 165 | Unde perfectius fieret iudicium ex experimentali pulsuum tali differentia et pondere urinae quam tactu venae et colore urinae tantum. | Whence, a judgment would be made more perfectly from such an experimental difference of pulses and the weight of urine than from the touch of the vein and the color of urine alone. |
| 165 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 165 | Optime ais. | You speak excellently. |
| 165 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 165 | Adhuc: si spiritum seu anhelitum per inspirationem et expirationem iam dicta ponderum aquae habitudine attingeret, nonne adhuc praecisius iudicium faceret? | Furthermore: if one were to attain the spirit or breath by inspiration and expiration by the same habit of weights of water, would he not make a more precise judgment? |
| 165 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 165 | Faceret certe. | He certainly would. |
| 166 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 166 | Si enim fluente aqua ex clepsedra centum numeraret expirationes in puero et similiter in sene, non est possibile aquas eiusdem ponderis evenire. | For if, with water flowing from a clepsydra, one counted one hundred expirations in a boy and similarly in an old man, it is not possible for the waters to be of the same weight. |
| 166 | Sic dico in aliis diversis aetatibus et complexionibus. | I say this also in the case of other diverse ages and complexions. |
| 166 | Unde, quando medico constaret pondus expirationis sani aut pueri aut adolescentis et similiter aegrotantis varia infirmitate, indubie tali experimento ad notitiam sanitatis et casus ab ipsa atque ad dosim remediorum citius perveniret. | Whence, when it would be known to a physician what the weight of expiration is in a healthy man or a boy or an adolescent, and similarly in one who is sick with various infirmities, undoubtedly by such an experiment he would arrive sooner at the knowledge of health and its loss, and at the dose of remedies. |
| 166 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 166 | Immo etiam ad coniecturas periodi. | Indeed, even at conjectures about the period of disease. |
| 166 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 166 | Bene dicis. | You speak well. |
| 166 | Si enim reperiret in sano adolescente pondus senis et decrepiti, coniceret illum citius moriturum, et tales faceret admirabiles coniecturas. | For if he were to find in a healthy adolescent the weight of an old man or a decrepit man, he would conjecture that the latter would die sooner, and make such admirable conjectures. |
| 166 | Adhuc: si in febribus per similem modum paroxysmos calidos et frigidos per ponderum aquae differentiam annotaret, nonne morbi efficaciam ac remedii opportunitatem verius pertingere posset? | Furthermore: if in fevers he were to note, in a similar manner, the hot and cold paroxysms by the difference of the weight of water, would he not be able to arrive at a truer knowledge of the efficacy of the disease and the opportune time for remedy? |
| 166 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 166 | Indubie posset! | Undoubtedly he could! |
| 166 | Experiretur enim victoriam unius qualitatis super aliam, caloris super frigus aut e converso, et secundum repertam habitudinem medelas applicaret. | For he would experience the victory of one quality over another, of heat over cold or conversely, and would apply remedies according to the found habit. |
| 167 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 167 | Adhuc dico in variis nationibus et regionibus et temporibus ista variari in identitate aetatis. | I say further that these things vary in different nations, regions, and times, even in the identity of age. |
| 167 | Unde varietatem ponderum secundum omnia designari quamvis difficile, tamen utilissimum foret. | Whence, it would be very useful, although difficult, to designate the variety of weights according to all things. |
| 167 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 167 | Sic est ut ais. | It is as you say. |
| 167 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 167 | Videtur autem, quod pondus omnium rerum considerandum foret uti medium diversitatis ponderum eius in diversis climatibus, ut, si pondus hominis in comparatione ad aliud animal considerandum foret, tunc homo est considerandus non ut septentrionem aut meridiem, ubi hincinde est excessus, sed potius ut clima medium inhabitans. | But it seems that the weight of all things ought to be considered as the mean of the diversity of weights of it in different climates, so that if the weight of a man were to be considered in comparison to that of another animal, then the man is to be considered not as inhabiting the north or south, where there is an excess on one side or the other, but rather as inhabiting a middle climate. |
| 167 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 167 | Optime ais. | You speak excellently. |
| 167 | Veteres clima illud diarhodon appellarunt; nam ab oriente ad occasum per Rhodum insulam tendit. | The ancients called that climate "diarhodon," for it extends from east to west through the island of Rhodes. |
| 167 | Sed quaeso, si totius hominis pondus in comparatione ad aliud aliquod animal quaereres, quomodo procederes? | But I ask, if you were to seek the weight of the whole man in comparison to that of some other animal, how would you proceed? |
| 167 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 167 | Hominem in libra ponerem, cui simile pondus appenderem in alia parte. | I would put the man in a balance, to which I would attach a similar weight on the other side. |
| 167 | Deinde hominem in aquam mitterem, et iterum extra aquam ab alia parte aequale appenderem, et diversitatem ponderum annotarem, faceremque itidem cum animali dato, et ex varia diversitate ponderum quaesitum annotarem. | Then I would throw the man into the water, and again, outside the water, I would attach an equal weight on the other side, and note the difference of weights, and I would do the same with the given animal, and note the sought-for difference. |
| 167 | Post hoc attenderem ad ponderum hominis et animalis diversitatem extra aquam; et secundum hoc moderarem inventum et conscriberem. | After this, I would attend to the difference of the weights of the man and the animal outside the water; and according to this, I would moderate my finding and record it. |
| 168 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 168 | Hanc moderationem non capio. | I do not understand this moderation. |
| 168 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 168 | Ostendam tibi, inquit. | I will show you, he said. |
| 168 | Et accepto ligno levi, cuius pondus ut tria, et aquae eiusdem magnitudinis ut quinque, ipsum in duas divisit inaequales partes, quarum una habuit duplam magnitudinem, alia simplam; ambas in cuppam altam posuit et cum fuste tenuit ac aquam superfudit; et fuste retracta ascenderunt ligna ad aquae superficiem, et maius lignum citius quam minus. | And taking a light wood, whose weight was as three, and water of the same magnitude as five, he divided it into two unequal parts, one having double the magnitude, the other simple; he put both in a high cup and held them with a stick and poured water over them; and, withdrawing the stick, the woods rose to the surface of the water, and the larger wood rose sooner than the smaller. |
| 168 | Ecce, aiebat, tu vides diversitatem motus in identitate proportionis ex eo evenire, quia in levibus lignis in maiori est plus levitatis. | Behold, he said, you see that the difference of motion in the identity of proportion arises from this, that in lighter woods there is more lightness in the larger one. |
| 168 | Orator. | The orator. |
| 168 | Video et placet multum. | I see it and it pleases me very much. |
| 168 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 168 | Sic dico moderationem fieri debere. | I say that moderation ought to be done in this way. |
| 168 | Si enim homo ob magnitudinem super animal plus gravitatis haberet, citius in aqua quam animal eiusdem proportionis descenderet. | For if the man, because of his magnitude, had more gravity than the animal, he would descend in the water sooner than the animal of the same proportion. |
| 168 | Quare tunc oporteret moderationem repertae differentiae diminuendo proportionaliter fieri secundum excessum. | Therefore, it would be necessary to make the moderation of the found difference by decreasing proportionally according to the excess. |
| 169 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 169 | Intelligo nunc. | I understand now. |
| 169 | Sed dicito: quomodo resistit aqua, ne descendat lignum? | But how does the wood resist the water and not sink? Explain that. |
| 169 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 169 | Ut maior gravedo minori. | The greater bulk displaces the lesser. |
| 169 | Quare, si lignum rotundum in ceram presseris et extraxeris locum aqua implendo, et huius aquae pondus similiter et ligni notaveris, comperies, si pondus ligni excedit pondus aquae, lignum descendere, si non, natare et super aquam partem proportionalem ligni manere secundum excessum ponderis aquae super pondus ligni. | If, for example, you press a round piece of wood into a jar of water and remove it, filling the space with water, and if you note the weight of the water as well as that of the wood, you will find that if the weight of the wood is greater than that of the water, then the wood will sink; but if the weight of the water is greater, the wood will float, and a part of it will remain above the water corresponding to the excess of the water's weight over that of the wood. |
| 169 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 169 | Cur dicis de rotundo ligno? | Why do you speak of a round piece of wood? |
| 169 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 169 | Si fuerit latae figurae, de aqua plus occupabit et elevatius natabit. | If the wood is shaped like a board, it will displace more water and float higher. |
| 169 | Hinc naves in aquis paucae profunditatis esse debent latioris fundi. | That is why ships should have wider bottoms in shallow water. |
| 170 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 170 | Continua inceptum, an aliter pondera animalium attingi possint? | So you think that the method you've described is the only way to measure weights? |
| 170 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 170 | Possent puto. | Oh, there are other ways, I think. |
| 170 | Nam si tinam usque ad summum aqua impleres ipsamque in aliam locares, deinde hominis pondus extra aquam caperes, post hoc ipsum in tinam illam descendere faceres, et aquam quae efflueret colligeres et ponderares: et pariformiter in alio aut homine aut animali aut alia re quacumque procedendo ex diversitate ponderum subtili ratione quaesitum attingeres. | For instance, if you were to fill a vessel completely with water and pour this water into another container, then take out a man's weight without the water, you would make the same man sink into the vessel, and by collecting and weighing the water that flows out, you could find the difference in weights by a subtle calculation. |
| 170 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 170 | Subtiliter multum audivi, inquit orator, aliquando hoc ingenio metallorum differentiam repertam, atque nonnullos annotasse, quantum fusio unciae cerae colligit auri, argenti, cupri et ita de omnibus metallis. | I have heard a very subtle argument, said the speaker, by which the difference in weights of metals can be discovered, and some have noted how much an ounce of wax obtains from gold, silver, copper, and so on for all metals. |
| 171 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 171 | Laudandus est ille, qui per fusionem magnitudinem intelligit. | That man deserves praise, who understands their weight through fusion. |
| 171 | Vidit enim, si aurum tantum loci occuparet, quantum uncia cerae, quod tunc eius pondus tale foret. | For he saw that if gold occupied as much space as an ounce of wax, then its weight would be the same. |
| 171 | Ita de aliis metallis. | The same goes for other metals. |
| 171 | Nam certissimum est aliud esse pondus auri, aliud argenti et ceterorum in aequalitate magnitudinis; et aliud cuiuslibet pondus in aëre, aliud in aqua, aliud in oleo aut alio liquore. | It is certain that the weight of gold differs from that of silver and all the other metals, even when they have the same bulk; and the weight of any metal in air differs from its weight in water, or in oil or any other liquid. |
| 171 | Unde, si quis pondera illa omnia signata teneret, ille profecto sciret, quantum unum metallum est gravius alteri in aëre et quantum in aqua. | Therefore, if someone were to keep all these weighed amounts, they would certainly know how much one metal outweighs another in air, and how much it does so in water. |
| 171 | Hinc, data quacumque massa, per ponderum eius diversitatem in aëre et aqua scire posset, cuius metalli massa foret et cuius mixturae. | From this, given any bulk, one could know by the difference in weights in air and water what metal the bulk consists of and what is the alloy. |
| 171 | Et sicut dictum est de aëre et aqua, ita etiam de oleo dici posset aut alio quocumque humore, in quo experientia facta fuisset. | And as I said for air and water, the same could be said for oil or any other fluid in which an experiment is performed. |
| 171 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 171 | Sic absque massae fusione et metallorum separatione mixtura attingeretur, et ingenium istud in monetis utile foret ad sciendum, quantum cupri immixtum sit auro aut argento. | So without having to melt the metals and separate them from the alloy, one could discover the mixture, and this method would be useful for assaying coins, to know how much copper has been mixed with gold or silver. |
| 171 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 171 | Bene dicis. | You're right. |
| 171 | Valeret etiam plurimum ad sophistica alchimica opera cognoscenda, quantum a veritate deficerent. | It would also be extremely useful for detecting the frauds of alchemists, and seeing how far they deviate from the truth. |
| 172 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 172 | Si quis igitur librum ponderum conscribere proponeret, illum etiam varietatem metalli cuiuslibet annotare oporteret, ut videtur; nam alterius ponderis est aurum Ungaricum, alterius aurum obrison. | If someone were to write a book on weights, it would seem that he should also note the variety of each metal's weight, for Hungarian gold has a different weight to Aurichalcum. |
| 172 | Ita de singulis metallis. | The same goes for all other metals. |
| 172 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 172 | Ex praemissis constat: uti in fontibus ita et mineris diversitatem ponderis reperiri. | From the preceding discussion, it's clear that the weights of metals vary according to their nature. |
| 172 | Aurum tamen ubicumque reperiatur, semper est ponderosius quam aliud metallum. | But wherever gold is found, it's always heavier than other metals. |
| 172 | Unde species illa auri intra quandam ponderis latitudinem variari reperitur. | Hence, there is a certain range of weights within which the appearance of gold varies. |
| 172 | Ita de reliquis. | The same goes for the others. |
| 172 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 172 | An ex habitudine ponderum metallorum naturarum venari possit habitudo? | Can the nature of metals be guessed by their weights? |
| 172 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 172 | Plumbum est auro similius in pondere, sed in perfectione nequaquam. | Lead is similar to gold in weight, but in no other respect. |
| 172 | Unde non ad unum pondus tantum attendendum censeo, sed ad singula pondera. | So I think we should not attend to a single weight, but to each weight individually. |
| 172 | Nam ad pondera ignis fusionis tam auri quam plumbi si quis attendit, minus reperit plumbum ad aurum accedere quam aliud metallum; et si quis ad pondera ignis in ferri fusione attendit, sibi occurrit ferrum plus accedere ad aurum quam aliud metallum, licet quoad pondus gravedinis minus. | For if one considers the weights after fusing gold or lead, one finds that lead is less likely to be alloyed with gold than any other metal; and if one considers the weights after fusing iron, one finds that iron adheres more to gold than any other metal, although it is less heavy. |
| 172 | Unde omnia pondera attendi debent, non gravitas tantum, et tunc comperimus argentum auro propinquius. | Therefore, all weights should be taken into account, not just heaviness, and then we would discover that silver is closer to gold than any other metal. |
| 173 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 173 | Vitruvius ait de pondere naturae auri, quod solum in argento vivo submergitur, cuiuscumque etiam parvae gravedinis fuerit, aliis metallis supranatantibus, cuiuscumque magnae molis existant. | Vitruvius said that the weight of nature's gold is such that it alone can sink in molten silver, no matter how small its bulk, while other metals float, however great their mass. |
| 173 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 173 | Argentum vivum cum omnibus metallis coniungibile est propter commune, quod est in ipso et illis. | Living silver combines with all metals because it has something in common with them. |
| 173 | Sed magis amorose auro adhaeret, sicut minime perfectum suae propriae naturae perfectissimae. | But it adheres to gold with greater affection, like an imperfect thing to the most perfect thing of its own nature. |
| 173 | Hinc qui alchimicis vacant argentum vivum in igne domare student, quousque non solum non fugiat ab igne, sed omnia metalla, quibus iungitur, secum fixa teneat, et non solum hoc, sed et in pondus auri stringat remanente fluxibili et malleabili humiditate, atque tingat colore fixo et permanente. | Hence those who work on taming wild silver in the fire strive to reach a point where not only does it not flee from the fire, but also binds all the metals to which it is joined, and not only this, but draws them into the weight of gold while remaining fluid and malleable, and dyes them with a fixed and enduring color. |
| 173 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 173 | Putas eos posse efficere quod proponunt? | Do you think they can achieve what they propose? |
| 173 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 173 | Praecisio manet inattingibilis, sed quantum profecerint, statera ostendit, sine qua nihil certi efficere poterint: iudicio enim ignis et staterae huius rei inquisitio permittitur. | The goal remains unattainable, but they can get close, and the scales show how far. Without them, nothing could be ascertained with certainty: the judgment of fire and these scales is the only way to inquire into this matter. |
| 174 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 174 | Possent similiter lapides omnes pretiosi ponderari? | Could all precious stones likewise be weighed? |
| 174 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 174 | Non dubium uno ingenio omnia fieri posse. | I don't see why not; the same method could be applied to all. |
| 174 | Nam aliud est pondus diamantis in ordine ad aequalem magnitudinem plumbi et aliud saphiri similiter in ordine ad aequalitatem magnitudinis plumbi. | For the weight of a diamond in relation to an equal bulk of lead differs from that of a sapphire, and so on for all other stones. |
| 174 | Et ex diversitate scitur habitudo ponderum utriusque, et ita de omnibus lapidibus. | And from this difference, one can know their habitus weights, and so on for all jewels. |
| 174 | Unde perutile foret pondera ista via statici experimenti conscripta habere cum suis differentiis originum, ut, si quae sophisticationes in berillo aut cristallo colorato fierent, deprehendi possent. | Therefore, it would be very useful to have a record of these weights obtained by static experiment, along with their differences according to origin, so that any sophistication in beryl or colored crystal could be detected. |
| 174 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 174 | Etiam aliud est pondus lapidis in aëre, aliud in aqua, aliud in oleo. | Moreover, the weight of a stone is different in air and water, and again different in oil. |
| 174 | Pulchrum foret istas diversitates haberi, ut sine habitudine ad plumbum vel aliud tertium differentia ponderum sciretur. | It would be desirable to have these differences recorded, so that the weights could be known without any reference to lead or any other third substance. |
| 174 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 174 | Optime dicis. | You speak wisely. |
| 175 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 175 | Dicito, si tibi occurrit virtutes lapidum aliquo ingenio ponderari posse? | Tell me, can the virtues of stones be weighed by any artifice? |
| 175 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 175 | Puto, quod virtus magnetis ponderaretur, si posito in libra ferro in una parte et magnete in alia usque ad aequilibram, deinde amoto magnete tanti ponderis alio gravi in locum posito, magnes supra ferrum teneretur, ita quod ferrum in bilancza sursum ad magnetem moveretur, quo moto extra aequalitatem in alia parte pondus aggravaretur, quousque ferrum ad aequalitatem rediret magnete immoto remanente: puto, quod per pondus retrahens virtus magnetis proportionabiliter ponderata dici posset. | I think the virtue of a magnet could be weighed, by placing an iron weight in one pan of a balance and the magnet in the other, until they reach equilibrium. Then, if you remove the magnet and replace it with another weight, the magnet will hold the iron above it, so that the iron in the balance will be drawn upwards, tilting the balance towards the magnet until it returns to equilibrium when the new weight is removed. In this way, the virtue of the magnet could be weighed proportionately. |
| 175 | Similiter etiam virtus diamantis venaretur ex hoc, quod magnetem prohibere dicitur ne ferrum attrahat, et aliae aliorum lapidum virtutes suo modo, atque etiam ex diversitate magnitudinis corporum, cum in maiore corpore sit maior virtus. | The virtue of a diamond could also be weighed, for it is said to prevent a magnet from attracting iron, and the same could be done for the virtues of other stones, each in its own way, and also according to the size of the stone, since a larger stone has a greater virtue. |
| 176 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 176 | Nonne etiam experiri posset artifex, quantum argenti vivi et quantum sulphuris contineat quodlibet metallum et similiter lapides? | Couldn't an artisan also experiment to discover how much living silver and sulfur are contained in any metal or stone? |
| 176 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 176 | Posset certe ex concordantia et differentia ponderum omnia talia propinque investigare. | Certainly, he could investigate all such things by agreement and difference in weights. |
| 176 | Et similiter elementa argenti vivi ex diversitate ponderis sui in aëre, in aqua et in oleo comparata ad aquam et oleum, et cineres eiusdem magnitudinis ponderatos; sic et de sulphure. | And in the same way, one could find the elements of living silver by comparing the differences in its weight in air, water, and oil, relative to water and oil, and the ashes of equal bulk; the same could be done for sulfur. |
| 176 | Ita et per hoc ad omnium metallorum et lapidum elementa et pondus elementorum coniectura veriore pertingere posset. | In this way, an artisan could also very accurately guess at the elements of all metals and stones, and the weight of their elements. |
| 176 | Orator. | Speaker. |
| 176 | Pulchra sunt ista; nonne et ita in herbis et lignis et carnibus et animalibus et humoribus? | These are admirable points; surely the same could be done for plants and wood, flesh and animals, and their humors? |
| 176 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 176 | In omnibus puto. | I think so, in all of them. |
| 176 | Nam ponderato ligno et, illo exusto, cineribus ponderatis scitur quantum aquae fuit in ligno: solum enim aqua et terra pondus grave habent. | For if you weigh the wood, and after burning it, weigh the ashes, you will know how much water was in the wood, since only water and earth have gravity. |
| 176 | Scitur similiter ex diversitate ponderis ligni in aëre, aqua ac oleo quantum aqua illa, quae in ligno est, gravior aut levior est aqua fontis pura et sic quantum aëris; ita ex diversitate ponderum cinerum quantum ignis. | Similarly, the difference in the weight of wood in air, water, and oil will show how much the water in the wood is heavier or lighter than pure fountain water, and thus how much air the wood contains; in this way, the difference in the weights of the ashes will show how much fire was present. |
| 176 | Et venantur sic elementa veriore coniectura, licet praecisio sit semper inattingibilis. | And so the elements are discovered by guess, though always approximately. |
| 176 | Et uti de ligno dictum est, ita de herbis, carnibus et aliis. | And as I said for wood, the same can be done for herbs, flesh, and other things. |
| 177 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 177 | Nullum purum dabile dicitur elementum: quomodo hoc experimur per stateram? | No pure element is said to be dable: how do we experience this through a balance? |
| 177 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 177 | Si quis positis centum libris terrae in testa colligeret ex herbis aut seminibus in terram proiectis prius ponderatis, successive centum libras et iterum terram ponderaret, in pauco ipsam in pondere reperiret diminutam. | If someone were to gather 100 pounds of earth in a hat from herbs or seeds thrown on the ground, previously weighed, and then weigh the earth again, successively weighing 100 pounds and then the earth again, they would find the earth itself to be slightly diminished in weight. |
| 177 | Ex quo haberet collectas herbas pondus ex aqua potius habere. | From which they would have the weight of the collected herbs from water rather than from the earth. |
| 177 | Aquae igitur in terra ingrossatae terrestreitatem attraxerunt, et opera solis in herbam sunt condensatae. | Therefore, the water, having been accumulated on the earth, has attracted the earth's weight, and the work of the sun has been condensed into the herb. |
| 177 | Si herbae illae incinerentur, nonne per coniecturam ex ponderum omnium diversitate attingeres, quantum terrae plus centum libris reperires, et illam aquam attulisse manifestum est? | If those herbs were to be incinerated, wouldn't you, by inference from the diversity of all weights, reach the conclusion that there is more earth than 100 pounds, and that it is clear that the water has been added? |
| 177 | Convertuntur elementa unum in aliud per partes, uti experimur vitro in nive posito aërem in vitro in aquam condensari, quam in vitro fluidam reperimus. | The elements are converted into one another through parts, as we experience with glass placed in snow, where air is condensed in the glass, which we find to be fluid. |
| 177 | Sic experimur certam aquam in lapides verti, uti aqua in glaciem, et virtutem indurativam ac lapidificativam certis fontibus inesse, qui imposita indurant in lapidem. | Thus, we experience a certain water turning into stones, like water turning into ice, and the virtue of hardening and petrifying is found in certain springs, which harden things placed in them into stone. |
| 177 | Ita dicitur aquam quandam Ungariae reperiri, quae ob virtutem vitrioli, quae in ea est, vertit ferrum in cuprum. | Thus, it is said that a certain water is found in Hungary, which, due to the virtue of vitriol, which is in it, turns iron into copper. |
| 177 | Ex talibus enim virtutibus constat aquas non esse pure elementales, sed elementatas. | From such virtues, it is clear that waters are not pure elements, but elementated. |
| 177 | Et delectabile multum foret omnium talium aquarum variarum virtutum habere pondera, ut ex diversitate ponderum in aëre et oleo ad coniecturas virtutum appropinquaremus. | And it would be very delightful to have the weights of all such waters with various virtues, so that from the diversity of weights in air and oil, we could approach inferences about their virtues. |
| 178 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 178 | Sic et de terra? | So, and from the earth? |
| 178 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 178 | Immo et de terra, quoniam una est ferax, alia sterilis, et in una reperiuntur lapides et minerae, quae non reperiuntur in alia. | Rather, and from the earth, since one is fertile, the other is barren, and in one, we find stones and minerals that are not found in the other. |
| 178 | Terrarum igitur diversarum varia pondera in aqua, aëre et oleo scire multum utile foret ad secretam naturam perquirendam. | Therefore, the various weights of different earths in water, air, and oil would be very useful to know, in order to seek out the secret nature. |
| 178 | Ita et ex vinorum, cerae, oleorum, gummarum, albuminum, squillarum, porrorum, alleorum et omnium talium ponderum varietate virtutes, quae varie illis insunt, aliqualiter venari posse arbitror. | And so, from the weights of wines, wax, oils, gums, albumen, squills, porros, alleos, and all such things, we could hunt for the virtues that are variously in them. |
| 178 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 178 | In maximo volumine ista vix conscriberentur. | In a very large volume, these things would hardly be written. |
| 178 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 178 | Experimentalis scientia latas deposcit scripturas. | Experimental science demands broad writings. |
| 178 | Quanto enim plures fuerint, tanto infallibilius de experimentis ad artem, quae ex ipsis elicitur, posset deveniri. | For the more writings there are, the more infallibly can we arrive at the art that is elicited from them through experiments. |
| 179 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 179 | Forte ad aëris pondus etiam aliquando per coniecturas subtiles ascenderetur? | Perhaps the weight of air could also be ascended to through subtle inferences at times? |
| 179 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 179 | Si quis in libra magna parte una appenderet multam lanam et siccam atque adustam, et alia parte lapides usque ad aequilibram, in loco et aëre temperato, experiretur aëre ad humiditatem declinante pondus lanae crescere et aëre ad siccitatem tendente decrescere. | If someone were to hang a large amount of dry and scorched wool on one side of a balance and stones up to the equilibrium on the other side, in a temperate place and air, and were to experience the weight of the wool increasing as the air becomes more humid and decreasing as the air becomes drier, he would be able to ponder the difference in the air and make likely inferences about the change of seasons. |
| 179 | Unde hic tali differentia aërem ponderaret atque verisimiles coniecturas de temporum mutatione faceret. | From which he would be able to ponder the air and make likely inferences about the change of seasons. |
| 179 | Sic si quis solis vigorem varium attingere cuperet in variis climatibus, hic si de fertilioribus agris tam unius quam alterius climatis mille grana aut tritici aut ordei ponderaret, ex diversitate ponderum experiretur varium solis vigorem. | Thus, if someone wanted to experience the varying strength of the sun in different climates, he could weigh a thousand grains of wheat or barley from fertile lands in one or the other climate, and from the diversity of weights, he would experience the varying strength of the sun. |
| 179 | Numero enim atque agro aeque fertili existente quoad locum quemlibet differentia non nisi ex sole esse poterit. | For, with equal number and equally fertile land, the only difference would be from the sun. |
| 179 | Sic etiam differentia venari posset vigoris solis in loco montium et vallium, in eadem linea orientis et occasus. | Thus, the difference in the strength of the sun could also be hunted in the location of mountains and valleys, on the same line of east and west. |
| 180 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 180 | Nonne si quis ex alta turri lapidem cadere sineret, fluente ex stricto foramine aqua in pelvim aquam interim effluxam ponderando, et similiter ligno aequalis magnitudinis cadente idem fecerit: ex diversitate ponderum aquae, ligni et lapidis posset ad aëris pondus devenire? | Doesn't it seem that if someone were to let a stone fall from a high tower, and, while flowing through a narrow opening, the water in the pit were to be weighed, and he were to do the same with a piece of wood of equal size, he could reach the weight of air through the diversity of weights of water, wood, and stone? |
| 180 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 180 | Si quis in diversis aequalibus turribus et diversis temporibus hoc faceret, posset tandem ad coniecturam pertingere. | If someone were to do this in different equal towers and at different times, he could eventually reach an inference. |
| 180 | Citius tamen ad aëris pondus pertingeret per figurarum varietatem in aequalitate gravedinis, ut, si libram plumbi in figura sphaerica de turri cadere sinerem, aquam ex clepsedra colligendo, et deinde libram similis plumbi in figura lata emitterem, similiter aquam colligendo: ex diversitate ponderum aquarum pondus aëris attingeretur. | However, he would reach the weight of air more quickly through the variety of shapes in equal weight, such as if I were to let a lead weight fall from a tower in the shape of a sphere, collecting the water from a clepsydra, and then were to let a similar lead weight fall in the shape of a flat object, collecting the water from a clepsydra: the weight of the water would reach the weight of air. |
| 180 | Experimur enim aves extensis alis fixius manere, quia plus de aëre occupant, sicut et in aqua citius descendit grave compactum in sphaeram quam in quadrum extensum. | For we experience that birds, with their wings extended, remain fixed, because they occupy more air, just as a heavy object sinks more quickly in water in a sphere than in a square shape. |
| 180 | Et sicut tali ingenio aëris pondus, ita et aquae venari posset atque e converso figurarum varia capacitas. | And just as we can hunt the weight of air through such ingenuity, so too can we hunt the capacity of water and its converse through various shapes. |
| 181 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 181 | Audivi quodam ingenio maris profunditatem venari. | I heard that the depth of the sea could be hunted through some ingenuity. |
| 181 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 181 | Cum plumbo fieret formato ad instar lunae octo dierum, ita tamen, quod cornu unum sit ponderosius et aliud levius, et in leviori pomum aut aliud leve tali ingenio appendatur, quod plumbo in fundum pomum trahente et primo cum ponderosiori parte terram tangente et se sic successive inclinante pomum de cornu liberatum sursum revertatur, habita scientia per simile plumbum et pomum in alia aqua notae profunditatis. | When a lead weight, shaped like the moon after eight days, was made, it was still the case that one horn was heavier and the other lighter, and on the lighter horn, a light object or another light object was attached, which, when the lead weight was dropped and the object was released, would rise up, having knowledge of the depth of the water through a similar lead weight and object in another body of water. |
| 181 | Nam ex diversitate ponderis aquae ex clepsedra a tempore proiectionis plumbi et reversionis pomi in diversis aquis scitur quaesitum. | For from the diversity of the weight of the water from the clepsydra at the time of the lead weight's projection and the object's return, the sought-after depth is known. |
| 182 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 182 | Credo tali et aliis modis profunditatem aquarum investigari posse. | I believe that the depth of waters can also be investigated through other methods. |
| 182 | Sed dicito: nonne etiam velocitas motus navis conici sic poterit? | But say: can't the speed of a ship's motion be inferred in this way? |
| 182 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 182 | Ut quo modo? | How so? |
| 182 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 182 | Scilicet per proiectionem pomi in aquam ex prora et fluxum aquae ex clepsedra, quousque pomum ad puppim pervenerit, atque comparatione ponderum aquae uno et alio tempore. | Certainly, through the projection of an object into the water from the prow and the flow of water from the clepsydra, until the object reaches the stern, and by comparing the weights of the water at one and the other time. |
| 182 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 182 | Immo illo aut alio modo, scilicet per ballistrationem et accessum navis ad sagittam citius et tardius cum aqua clepsedrae. | Rather, in that or another way, namely through ballistae and the ship's approach to the mark more quickly and more slowly with the water from the clepsydra. |
| 182 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 182 | Etiam vis arcuum et ballistarum videtur proportionabiliter inquiri posse per fluxum aquae ex clepsedra ab eo puncto temporis, quo sagitta diametraliter sursum mittitur et revertitur ad terram, ita quod in diversis ballistis aequalis sit sagitta. | And the force of bows and ballistae also seems to be able to be inquired about proportionally through the flow of water from the clepsydra from the point in time when the arrow is shot diametrically upwards and returns to the earth, so that in different ballistae, the arrow is equal. |
| 182 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 182 | Vis ballistarum, bombardarum, immo et ventorum, sic et cursuum hominum et animalium atque virium, et quidquid simile dici potest, coniecturaliter ex staticis experimentis atque fluxu aquae ex clepsedra poterit investigari. | The force of ballistae, bombardas, rather and winds, and the courses of men and animals and virtues, and whatever can be said similarly, can be investigated through static experiments and the flow of water from the clepsydra. |
| 183 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 183 | Quomodo fortitudo hominis scietur? | How will the strength of a man be known? |
| 183 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 183 | Videbis, quantum ponderis in bilancza una positi homo per attractionem alterius vacuae bilanczae ad aequalitatem levare possit. | You will see, how much weight a man placed on one balance can lift by attracting the other empty balance to equilibrium. |
| 183 | Deinde huius hominis pondus de pondere elevato defalcabis. | Then, subtract the weight of the man from the lifted weight. |
| 183 | Quod superest ex gravedine rei, fortitudini hominis proportionatur. | What remains, from the weight of the thing, is proportional to the man's strength. |
| 183 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 183 | Sic etiam spiritus hominis ponderari possit. | And thus, the man's spirit can also be weighed. |
| 183 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 183 | Aliud est pondus hominis attrahentis et tenentis anhelitum, aliud expirantis, et aliud vivi et aliud mortui, et sic in omnibus animalibus. | One thing is the weight of a man attracting and holding his breath, another is the weight of one exhaling, and another is the weight of a living man, and another is the weight of a dead man, and thus in all animals. |
| 183 | Unde pulchrum esset has differentias habere annotatas in diversis animalibus et diver sis hominibus et diversis hominum aetatibus, ut ad pondus spirituum vitalium coniectura ascendere posset. | Wherefore it would be pleasant to have these differences noted in different animals and different men and different ages of men, so that we could ascend to an inference about the weight of vital spirits. |
| 184 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 184 | Nonne calor et frigus et siccitas et humiditas temporis posset tali modo venari? | Doesn't it seem that temperature and heat and dryness and humidity of the time could be hunted in this way? |
| 184 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 184 | Posset certe! | It certainly can! |
| 184 | Nam si notaveris pondus aquae tempore gelu ante congelationem et post, varium reperies. | For if you note the weight of water before freezing and after, you will find it to be different. |
| 184 | Glacies enim cum videas supra aquam natare, scis eas aqua leviores. | For when you see ice floating on water, you know that it is lighter. |
| 184 | Unde secundum frigoris intensitatem maior est ponderis variatio. | Wherefore, according to the intensity of the cold, there is a greater variation in weight. |
| 184 | Sic etiam, si tempore caloris aquam exposueris aëri, pondus secundum tempus variatur. | Thus, if you expose water to the air in a warm time, the weight varies according to the time. |
| 184 | Aut si lignum viride ponderaveris et post tempus aliquod eius pondus mutatum reppereris, cognosces ex hoc frigoris et caloris excessum; sic et humiditatis et siccitatis. | Or if you weigh green wood and, after some time, find its weight to have changed, you will know from this the excess of cold and heat; thus, and dryness and humidity. |
| 184 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 184 | Nonne et tempus diei ponderari sic possit? | Doesn't it seem that the time of day can be weighed in this way? |
| 184 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. | 
| 184 | Si aquam ex clepsedra ab ortu ad ortum solis ceperis et ponderaveris et iterum fluere alia die ab ortu feceris, ex proportione ponderis effluxae aquae ad primum pondus horam et tempus diei scire poteris. | If you were to take water from a clepsydra from sunrise to sunrise and weigh it, and then were to make it flow again the next day from sunrise, you would be able to know the time of day from the proportion of the weight of the flowing water to the first weight of the hour. |
| 185 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 185 | Forte et temporis anni? | Is it by chance and the passage of a year? |
| 185 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 185 | Immo, si per annum ab ortu ad occasum per clepsedram omnium dierum notam signaveris, poteris semper et diem mensis et horam diei coniecturaliter statera attingere, licet diebus illis, quando parva est brevitatis earundem variatio, minus certe quam aliis. | Indeed, if through the year from east to west you were to note the shadow of all days on a sundial, you would always be able to conjecturally determine the day of the month and the hour of the day by means of a balance, although on those days when the variation in brevity is small, it would be less certain than on others. |
| 185 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 185 | Video tali ingenio usque ad motum corporum caelestium pertingi posse, uti Nemroth fecisse et Hipparchum scripsisse fertur. | I see that such ingenuity can extend even to the motion of celestial bodies, as Nemroth is said to have done and Hipparchus to have written. |
| 185 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 185 | Recte ais, licet tunc opus sit diligenti ratiocinatione. | You speak correctly, although at that time diligent reasoning is required. |
| 185 | Nam si quis in linea meridionali stella fixa notata ex clepsedra aquam usque ad stellae reditum colligeret faceretque similiter de sole ab ortu ad ortum, hic motum solis ad orientem ex diversitate minoritatis ponderis aquae, motus stellae de linea meridiana usque ad reditum ad eandem, et motus solis de ortu ad ortum reperiret. | For if someone on a meridian line were to collect water from a sundial, noting a fixed star, until the star returns, and were to do the same for the sun from sunrise to sunrise, he would discover the motion of the sun to the east from the difference in the weight of the water, the motion of the star from the meridian line to its return, and the motion of the sun from sunrise to sunrise. |
| 185 | Nam quantum minor foret, tantum in comparatione ad pondus totius motus foret in ordine ad circulum aequinoctialem, non zodiacum, qui super polos mundi non est descriptus, sed suos. | For the amount by which it would be less would be, in comparison to the weight of the entire motion, in order with respect to the equinoctial circle, not the zodiac, which is not described above the poles of the world, but its own. |
| 185 | Sic si quis per eandem stellam experiri vellet, quantum sol motus foret in quindecim diebus, hoc eodem modo ex varia distantia ortus solis in ordine ad situm stellae in linea meridiana facere posset, puta: si hodie distantia situs stellae in linea ab ortu solis in clepsedra reperitur in proportione aliqua ad pondus aquae totius revolutionis stellae, et iterum in quindecim diebus alia proportio ex diversitate motus reperiretur et semper in aequinoctiali. | Thus, if someone were to want to experiment with the same star to determine how much the sun would move in fifteen days, he could do so in the same way from the varying distance of the sunrise in order with respect to the position of the star on the meridian line, for example: if today the distance of the star's position on the meridian line from the sunrise is found on the sundial in some proportion to the weight of the water of the entire revolution of the star, and again in fifteen days another proportion is found from the difference in motion, and always in the equinoctial. |
| 186 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 186 | Potestne per hanc viam motus in zodiaco reperiri? | Can the motion in the zodiac be discovered through this method? |
| 186 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 186 | Potest certe per motum solis de meridie ad meridiem, et de oriente ad orientem, et de oriente ad occasum. | It can certainly be discovered through the motion of the sun from midday to midday, and from east to east, and from east to west. |
| 186 | Ex illis enim differentiis declinatio zodiaci ab aequinoctiali attingeretur. | For from those differences, the declination of the zodiac from the equinoctial can be determined. |
| 186 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 186 | Quid de varietate motus, qui ex eccentrico dicitur evenire? | What about the variation in motion that is said to occur due to the eccentric? |
| 186 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 186 | Et ille quidem reperietur, quando per annum inaequalitas in zodiaco in aequalibus diebus reperietur. | And that would indeed be discovered when, over the course of a year, inequality in the zodiac is found on equal days. |
| 186 | Non enim in aequali dierum numero sol de aequinoctiali per aestatem motus ad aequinoctialem redit, sicut in hieme, ubi citius; nam non tot diebus inveniretur de libra ad arietem, sicut de ariete ad libram peragrasse. | For the sun does not move from the equinoctial to the equinoctial in an equal number of days in summer as it does in winter, where it moves more quickly; for it is not found to have traveled from Libra to Aries in as many days as it has from Aries to Libra. |
| 186 | Ex qua differentia pateret excentricus sive parvus circulus differentiae motus. | From this difference, the eccentric or small circle of the difference in motion would be evident. |
| 187 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 187 | Quid de magnitudine corporis solis? | What about the magnitude of the body of the sun? |
| 187 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 187 | Ex pondere aquae fluentis clepsedrae ab initio ortus solis in aequinoctiali, quousque totus sit super horizontem, in habitudine ad aquam revolutionis stellae scitur propinqua habitudo magnitudinis corporis solis ad sphaeram suam. | From the weight of the water flowing from the sundial from the beginning of the sunrise at the equinox, until the entire sun is above the horizon, in relation to the water of the revolution of the star, the proximate relation of the magnitude of the body of the sun to its sphere is known. |
| 187 | Potest tamen alia via eius quantitas venari in eclipsibus solaribus. | Nevertheless, its quantity can be hunted down by another method in solar eclipses. |
| 187 | Orator. | Orator. |
| 187 | Quomodo? | How? |
| 187 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 187 | Motum lunae experimur modo quo solis. | We experience the motion of the moon in the same way as that of the sun. |
| 187 | Deinde ex eclipsi et motu eius per umbram terrae venamur magnitudinem lunae in ordine ad terrae umbram variam. | Then, from the eclipse and its motion through the shadow of the earth, we hunt down the magnitude of the moon in relation to the variable shadow of the earth. |
| 187 | Ex quibus mediam conicimus proportio nem esse magnitudinis eius ad terram. | From these, we conjecture that the proportion of its magnitude to the earth is moderate. |
| 187 | Deinde ex motu lunae et eclipsatione solis venamur solis a terra distantiam et magnitudinem subtili ingenio, coniecturaliter tamen. | Then, from the motion of the moon and the eclipse of the sun, we hunt down the distance and magnitude of the sun from the earth with subtle ingenuity, although conjecturally. |

| 187 | Per ea quae narrasti videtur, quod omnes motuum diversitates atque eclipses luminarium, immo omnium planetarum progressiones, stationes, retrogradationes, directiones eccentricitatesque attingere posses eodem et unico ingenio staterae et clepsedrae. | From what you have narrated, it seems that you can determine all the diversities of motions and eclipses of the luminaries, indeed all the progressions, stations, retrogradations, directions, and eccentricities of the planets by means of the same and single ingenuity of the balance and sundial. |

| 188 | Quid de iudiciis astrorum? | What about judgments of the stars? |
| 188 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 188 | Puto et ex varietate ponderum aquae unius et alterius anni et certis aliis differentiis ponderum lignorum et herbarum atque granorum frumenti posse conicere futuram fertilitatem aut caristiam ex praeteritis experimentis citius quam ex motu astrorum. | I think that even from the variation in the weights of the water of one year and another, and from certain other differences in the weights of woods and herbs and grains of wheat, one can conjecture future fertility or scarcity more quickly than from the motion of the stars. |
| 188 | Nam si in Martio pondus reperitur in certo gradu aquae et aëris atque lignorum ex terra, sequitur fertilitas: si secus, sterilitas aut mediocritas. | For if in March the weight is found in a certain degree of water and air and woods from the earth, fertility follows; if otherwise, sterility or mediocrity. |
| 188 | Sic de bellis, peste et similibus omnibus communibus. | So too with wars, pestilence, and all such common things. |
| 188 | Et haec radix est, ubi de his secundis stellis iudicium stellarum venamur, uti ex medullarum in animalibus, piscibus, cancris, arboribus et iuncis lunae aetatem et per fluxum maris eius situm venamur. | And this is the root from which we derive judgment of the stars, just as from the marrow of animals, fish, crabs, trees, and reeds we derive the age of the moon and its position through the flow of the sea. |

| 189 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 189 | Nulla est regio, quin, si quis adverteret, consimilia iudicia reperiret, quemadmodum ex pinguedine piscium et reptilium in principio hiemis frigus magnum et duraturum conicimus, contra quod natura sagax in animalibus praevidit. | There is no region where, if someone were to pay attention, similar judgments could not be discovered, just as from the fatness of fish and reptiles at the beginning of winter, we conjecture great and lasting cold, against which nature provides in animals with foresight. |

| 189 | Quid de quaestionibus, quae fiunt astrologis, an ne tuo ingenio reperiri posset aequa ad omnes responsio? | What about the questions that are put to astrologers - can an equal response to all be discovered by your ingenuity? |
| 189 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 189 | Etsi non aequa semper, posset tamen puto fieri aliqua. | Although not always equal, I think that some response could nevertheless be made. |
| 189 | Quomodo autem coniectura fieri posset ad interrogata, inquisitione magna indiget. | However, how a conjecture could be made in response to the questions being asked requires great investigation. |
| 189 | Nec est conveniens modus libris inscribi, licet fortassis respondens pondus responsionis non possit colligere nisi ex pondere interrogationis. | Nor is it suitable for a method to be written in books, although perhaps the respondent cannot collect the weight of the response except from the weight of the question. |
| 189 | Incitatio enim quaestionem moventis ad interrogandum ex praevisione aliqua futuri eventus mota esse videtur, licet unde motus sit non videat, sicut qui in oculo aliquid sentit quod non videt, investigat ab alio, ut videat quid desit. | For the incitement of the questioner to ask is seen to be moved by some foresight of a future event, although he does not see from where the motion comes, just as one who feels something in his eye that he does not see, investigates with another so that he may see what is lacking. |

| 190 | Arbitror te dicere velle: quemadmodum in rota Pythagorica ex varia combinatione nominis interrogantis matris, horae diei ac luminis lunae traditur modus responsa venandi, aut sicut vates ex sortibus aut lectione casuali librorum Sibyllinorum aut psalterii aut domibus caeli vel geomanticis figuris aut avium garritu seu flammae ignis flexione aut relatione tertii aut aliquo alio casuali interventu iudicium sumendum. | I think you want to say that just as in the Pythagorean wheel, from the varied combination of the name of the questioner, the mother, the hour of the day, and the light of the moon, a method of hunting down responses is handed down, or just as prophets from lots or casual reading of the Sibylline books or the psalter or the houses of the heavens or geomantic figures or the chatter of birds or the bending of a flame or the relation of a third party or some other casual intervention, judgment is to be taken. |
| 190 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 190 | Fuerunt, qui ex collocutione, quam cum interrogante habebant, in referendis novis de patriae dispositione venabantur indirecte responsionem, quasi spiritus impulsivus se in colloquiis longioribus manifestaret. | There were those who, from the conversation they had with the questioner, would hunt down an indirect response in reporting new things about the disposition of the country, as if a spirit were manifesting itself in longer conversations. |
| 190 | Si enim ad tristia vergebant colloquia, talis putabatur rei eventus, si ad laeta, laetus. | For if the conversations turned to sad things, the outcome of the matter was thought to be such; if to happy things, happy. |
| 190 | Ego autem ad faciem, vestes, motum oculorum, formam verborum atque ponderum, sortem rerum, quas iubeo interrogantem, iteratis ad me deferri vicibus attendens coniecturas formari posse coniciebam, praecisiores tamen ab illo, cui quid verius inpraemeditate incidit, in quo praesagus quidam spiritus loqui videtur. | I, however, attending to the face, clothes, movement of the eyes, form of words, and weight of things that I order the questioner to bring to me repeatedly, conjectured that conjectures could be formed, although more precise ones come from one to whom something more true has fallen into his mind, in whom a certain prophetic spirit seems to speak. |
| 190 | Arbitror tamen, nec in illa re artem possibilem nec habentem iudicium communicare posse nec sapientem circa ista vacare debere. | I think, however, that neither in that matter can an possible art or one having judgment be communicated, nor ought a wise person to be idle concerning these things. |

| 191 | Refert enim Sanctus Augustinus hominem bibulum suo tempore fuisse, cui mentium patebant cogitationes et fures detegebat et alia abscondita patefecit miro modo, licet levissimus foret et minime sapiens. | For Saint Augustine reports that there was a drunken man in his time, to whom the thoughts of minds were open and who detected thieves and revealed other hidden things in a wonderful way, although he was very frivolous and not at all wise. |

| 191 | Scio me saepe multa praedixisse, uti spiritus dedit, et causam penitus ignorabam. | I know that I have often predicted many things, as the spirit has given, and I have entirely ignored the cause. |

| 192 | Ad musicam statica experimenta utilissima sunt. | Static experiments are very useful for music. |
| 192 | Nam ex diversitate ponderum campanarum duarum tonum consonantium scitur, in qua harmonica proportione tonus consistat. | For from the diversity of the weights of two consonant bells, it is known in what harmonic proportion the tone consists. |
| 192 | Sic de fistularum pondere ac aquarum fistulas implentium scitur proportio: diapason, diapente ac diatessaron atque omnium harmoniarum qualitercumque formabilium. | So too from the weight of pipes and the water filling the pipes, the proportion is known: the diapason, diapente, and diatessaron, and all harmonies that can be formed in any way. |
| 192 | Similiter ex pondere malleorum, ex quorum casu super incudem aliqua oritur harmonia, ac guttarum de rupe in stagnum stillantium varias notas facientium et tibiarum ac omnium instrumentorum musicalium ratio praecisius statera attingitur. | Similarly, from the weight of hammers, from the fall of which on the anvil some harmony arises, and from the drops of water dripping from a rock into a pool, making various notes, and from flutes and all musical instruments, the ratio is more precisely determined by the balance. |

| 193 | Immo generaliter omnes harmonicae concordantiae per pondera subtilissime investigantur. | Rather, all harmonic concordances are most subtly investigated by weights. |
| 193 | Immo pondus rei est proprie harmonica proportio ex varia combinatione exorta. | Rather, the weight of a thing is truly a harmonic proportion arising from varied combinations. |
| 193 | Immo amicitiae et inimicitiae animalium et hominum eiusdem speciei ac mores, et quidquid tale ex harmonicis concordantiis et ex contrariis dissonantiis ponderatur. | Rather, the friendships and enmities of animals and humans of the same species, as well as their customs, and whatever else is weighed from harmonic concordances and opposing dissonances. |
| 193 | Sic et sanitas hominis harmonia ponderatur atque infirmitas; immo levitas et gravitas, prudentia et simplicitas et multa talia, si subtiliter advertis. | Thus, human health is weighed by harmony and weakness; rather, lightness and weight, prudence and simplicity, and many such things, if you observe subtly. |

| 194 | Quid censes de geometria? | What do you think of geometry? |
| 194 | Idiota. | The unlearned man. |
| 194 | Arbitror proportiones propinquas circuli et quadrati et alia omnia, quae ad differentiam capacitatis figurarum spectant, aptius per pondera quam aliter experiri posse. | I judge that the close proportions of the circle and square, and all other things which pertain to the difference in capacity of figures, can be more aptly experienced by weights than otherwise. |
| 194 | Nam si feceris vas columnare notae diametri et altitudinis et aliud cubicum eiusdem diametri et altitudinis et utrumque aqua impleveris et ponderaveris, nota tibi erit ex diversitate ponderum inscripti quadrati ad circulum, cui inscribitur proportio, et per hoc propinqua coniectura circuli quadratura, et quidquid circa hoc scire cupis. | For if you make a cylindrical vessel of a certain diameter and height and another cubic one of the same diameter and height, and fill both with water and weigh them, you will note from the difference in weights the inscribed square to the circle, to which the proportion is inscribed, and through this a close conjecture of the circle's quadrature, and whatever else you wish to know about this. |
| 194 | Sic si duas receperis laminas penitus aequales, et unam in orbem flexeris vas columnare efficiendo, et aliam in quadratum vas cubicum constituendo, et aqua vasa ipsa impleveris: scies ex differentia ponderum differentiam capacitatis circuli et quadrati aequalis peripheriae. | Thus, if you take two entirely equal sheets, and bend one into a circle to make a cylindrical vessel, and the other into a square to make a cubic vessel, and fill the vessels themselves with water: you will know from the difference in weights the difference in capacity of the circle and square of equal circumference. |
| 194 | Ita si plures tales laminas habueris, poteris in trigono, pentagono, hexagono et ita deinceps capacitatis differentias investigare. | Thus, if you have more such sheets, you will be able to investigate the differences in capacity in the triangle, pentagon, hexagon, and so on. |
| 194 | Similiter pondere pervenire poteris ad artem capacitatum vasorum qualiumcumque figurarum ac ad instrumenta mensurandi et ponderandi: quomodo staterae fiant, quomodo una libra elevet mille per distantiam a centro et varium descensum rectiorem et curviorem, ac quomodo omnia subtilia navium ingenia ac machinarum fieri debeant. | Similarly, by weight you will arrive at the art of the capacity of vessels of any figure, and to instruments of measuring and weighing: how balances are made, how one scale can lift a thousand by distance from the center and varied descent straighter and curvier, and how all subtle naval mechanisms and machines should be made. |
| 194 | Unde arbitror hanc staticam experientiam ad omnia geometrica perutilem esse. | Hence, I judge this static experience to be extremely useful for all geometry. |

| 195 | Satis nunc explanasti causas, cur rerum pondera optas per stateram capi et seriatim et multipliciter conscribi. | Enough now have you explained the causes why you desire the weights of things to be taken by a balance and recorded in series and multiplied. |
| 195 | Indeque videtur librum illum utilissimum futurum ac apud magnos sollicitandum esse, ut in diversis provinciis consignentur et comportentur in unum, ut ad multa nobis abscondita facilius perducamur. | Hence, it seems that this book will be most useful and should be urgently sought by the great, so that they may be recorded and gathered together in one from various provinces, so that we may more easily be led to many things hidden from us. |
